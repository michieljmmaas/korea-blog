# TWICE – This is For in Macau

One of my biggest goals for this trip was to see TWICE live. They are what first pulled me into Korean culture six years ago, when they released their single [Fancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOHB85vDuow). I’ve been a 'ONCE' ever since.  

I saw them once before, two years ago in Berlin. Up until then, I had only ever seen them through a screen, but seeing them in person (proving that they actually exist!) was an amazing experience. Being surrounded by like-minded fans, dancing and singing along, was so much fun.  

Originally, I planned to see them in Taiwan in november, but I missed out on ticket sales. I felt really down, afraid that I wouldn’t get to see them perform at all during my trip. Then I saw that they would perform in Macau, the day after I flew into Seoul. I quickly booked tickets, a flight, and a hotel. It was impulsive, but for the sake of the trip—and my own sanity—it had to be done. Opportunities to see them live are rare, so I had to grab it.  

I had planned on going both days, but the tickets I bought for the second day never arrived (luckily I got my money back), and there wasn’t enough time left to find new ones.  

## Do you want to know more?
If you’re unfamiliar with TWICE and want to explore their music or shows, here are some links:  
- [THIS IS FOR Stream-rip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BVXOoeJWsU) – A bootleg recording of their livestream concert in Incheon two months ago.  
- [Amazon Music Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjT6TRt_WJA) – A shorter (45 min) performance of their greatest hits. This one is in English, and the crowd is awesome!  
- [The TWICE playlist collection](https://linktr.ee/chronologyplaylists) – A fan-maintained library of playlists for new fans.  
  - I recommend starting here: [30-minute Spotify playlist of their biggest hits](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7o8wviIGuUOJSAuDwx5Roy?pi=Bkoas5GZQWC7o).  

## The concert
This concert was performed on a 360° stage, meaning the stage was in the center of the arena with fans all around it. The stage itself was shaped like an S and stretched almost the entire length of the floor. During the show, the members rotated and moved around so they could face every section of the audience. They did a great job, but a few times they turned just as a song’s highlight began, leaving us looking at their backs—or at the screens above.

After the first few songs and introductions, there was a costume change. To fill the time, the backup dancers performed a pretty cool dance break. Then TWICE returned with a set of more powerful songs.

Next came the solo performances. Each member performed a short song (just under two minutes), appearing at different spots around the stage. Fans scrambled to get better views. I moved up as well, since the two big black soundproofing circles were blocking mine. After all nine members had their solos, there was another costume change, filled by a live band shredding on guitars and keyboards.

After that came another change—this time covered by a video package.

Once the main setlist finished, the members went for one last costume change. While we waited, there was a crowd interaction segment where fans were invited to dance to TWICE’s songs. Then they returned for an encore with two final songs. This part was heavy on fan service, with the members walking around the stage, interacting with fans, and posing for photos.  

Finally, they gathered for a group photo, and the concert ended.

It was so much fun seeing them live again. The fans around me were hyped, and I could sing and dance my heart out! Most people near me filmed the entire concert, but I only took a few pictures. I rarely look at them afterwards, and being in the moment gave me a much better view of the performance. I even managed to make eye contact with some of the members (or at least I think I did).  

## Was it all worth it?
On the plane back from Macau, I started to evaluate my choices. Was this trip worth it? The money for the ticket, hotel, and flight. The stress of trying—and failing—to get tickets for the second day. The time and energy spent traveling. In total, I only spent about three hours in Macau actually exploring cultural sights, since I was locked up in my hotel room all day Saturday desperately trying to get tickets.  

But I don’t get many opportunities to see TWICE live, so I have to take them when they come. Seeing them in person was one of my main goals for this trip, and after missing out on tickets in Taiwan, things looked bleak. I really wanted these memories to be part of my journey, along with some merch to remind me of it. And all of this happened before I even knew I’d luck out and score tickets for their fan meeting on October 18th, which might have made me reconsider. 

So was it all worth it? For my own sanity, I’d say: *barely.*
