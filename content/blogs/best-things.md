This whole trip was an amazing experience. I have so many good memories of it, and I look back on it fondly. I would like to highlight the things that I liked most.

This post has a counterpart, and it's <Blog worst-things desc="My Flop 10">. You should check that out too!


## My Favorite Day - Hiking Bukhansan
My favorite day has to be <Day 17>. That day I climbed to the top of Bukhansan. The hike itself was nice, and I had great views until I got to the top, where it was so misty I couldn’t see more than 5 meters in front of me. But that wasn’t the point. For me, it was the journey. Reaching the top of that mountain felt like finally reaching the goal I had been working toward these past years. All the planning that went into this trip, the stress, and the emotions all came together there in one great moment.

## My Favorite Museum
I love modern art, and I got to see a lot of it on my trip. Of all the museums I visited, the **ARARIO Museum – In Space** has to be my favorite. The name is a bit confusing, as it is actually located in Seoul. The collection was excellent, and the building itself added a great atmosphere. I wrote a blogpost about it that you can read here: <Blog arario desc="ARARIO Museum in Space">

Honorable mentions: 
- Nam Jun Paik Art Center: <Day 9 link="nam-june-paik-art-center">
- The National Art Center – NITTEN: <Day 45>
- Taipei Fine Arts Museum: <Day 61>

## My Favorite Piece of Art - Love after Death
This amazing 47-minute-long multimedia display by Korakrit Arunanondchai has to be my favorite piece of art I saw all trip. The film was projected on a screen, and with certain lighting tricks and music they elevated it even further. Every five minutes I was impressed by how a new element transformed the display using sound, lighting, and video. I was fascinated by it.

It was displayed at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum that I visited on <Day 61>.

Honorable mentions: 
- Matrix - Nam Jun Paik Art - <Day 9>
- The Burghers of Calais - (Rodin) - <Day 10>
- Great Wave off Kanagawa (replica) - (Hokusai) - <Day 44>

## My Favorite Food - Roast Geese 
The food over there is amazing. It is tasty, affordable, and everywhere. But of all the things I ate, I have to say that I liked the roast geese I had in Hong Kong the most. The skin was crispy and the meat was really juicy. I especially like the fact that there is one less goose in the world because I ate this one. You can check out all my food reviews on the [Food](/food) tab.

Honorable mentions: 
- Tenkazushi - <Day 44>
- Beef Noodle Soup - <Day 56>
- Gimbap (everywhere)

## My Favorite Concert - TWICE Fanmeeting
I went to a couple of concerts on my trip, but my favorite has to be the TWICE Fanmeeting. I had amazing luck scoring tickets and had an incredible time singing along, playing games, and hanging out. It was such a special occasion, as it was their 10th debut anniversary. I wrote an extensive blogpost about it: <Blog fanmeeting desc="TWICE 10th ANIVERSARY FANMEETING - 10VE UNIVERSE">.

## My Favorite Legal Tender - Hong Kong Dollar
I used a lot of different currencies on my trip, but my favorite one has to be the Hong Kong Dollar. It is the 9th most traded currency in the world, and they really thought about the design. The bills have many different printings, all with beautiful artwork, and the coins are all different, so you can easily find what you are looking for. On top of that, the exchange rate with the euro is about 10-to-1, so the conversion is easy too!

## My Favorite Public Transit Card - Pasmo
I got to use four different public transit cards on my trip, so I got a taste of what they offer. Out of all of them, I have to say I liked the Japanese Pasmo card the most.

It was very convenient to use and recharge. I was able to not only pay for public transit, but also buy food in the train station. And best of all, it was made of very sturdy plastic with a metal sheen. I felt like I was using an Amex Platinum just to get on the metro!

## My Favorite Hike - Alisan
I went on a few hikes during my trip, but my favorite has to be while I was in **Alishan National Forest Recreation Area**. The forest is beautiful, the trails are well maintained, and the views are stunning. I also went to see the sunrise there on <Day 60>, which was an incredible experience.

If you are ever in Taiwan, I highly recommend it! Or you can read my blogpost with all the pictures I took while I was there: <Blog alisan desc="Alishan National Forest Recreation Area">.

## My Favorite Korean Conversation - At the Hairdresser
On <Day 20> I went to get my haircut. The hairdresser knew no English, but that didn’t matter. It was a great test of my Korean, which I have studied for the past five years. I was able to keep up with some small talk and explain what style I wanted. I even had a lesson about this exact situation, and it was the first time learning any language that it actually came up in real life! I even got some restaurant recommendations out of it.

Honorable mentions:
- A date with a Korean girl: <Day 16>
- Language exchange: <Day 22>

## My Favorite Social Event - Late Night Talks with Katherine
I left for the trip by myself and tried hard to meet new people. I was very lucky to meet Katherine during my stay in Seoul. We met up multiple times to have dinner together or go to a theme park. I loved talking to her, because she was so different from me in many ways. The more we hung out, the longer and more interesting the conversations got. My favorite has to be the one we had on <Day 40>. I had a stressful day at the office, and hanging out with her made it much better. After getting some 치맥, we went to the balcony of our hotel and talked until it got too cold to stay outside.

Honorable mentions:
- Culture exchange with a Bumble "date": <Day 26>
- Lotte World with Katherine & an e-sports final with strangers: <Day 31>
- Everland with strangers: <Day 32>
