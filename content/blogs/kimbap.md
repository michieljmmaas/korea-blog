The thing I missed most when I flew back to Seoul,
Wasn’t the sights, but that sweet seaweed roll.
Tuna, bulgogi, kimchi, or steak,
Every one so good, no choice a mistake.

Good for breakfast, for lunch, or for dinner,
And for under two euros — what a winner.
Rice, seaweed, veggies, and meat to munch,
With pickled radish adding that perfect amount of crunch.

You can eat it cold, lukewarm, or hot,
With a squeeze of mayo, or maybe not.
But leave it too long in the refrigerator,
And it turns from joy to a sad imitator.

I then tried a fresh kimbap, handmade and neat,
And my taste buds gasped — “Where have you been?”
Now the store ones feel like a washed-out sin,
Their magic gone stale, their glory obsolete.

I mourn what’s gone — that cheap delight,
Two euros of joy, now bland and unfair.
I still buy one sometimes, just standing there,
Then eat it and lie, “No, it’s still alright.”
