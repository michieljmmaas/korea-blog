It’s been a week since I checked into my hotel, **Mangrove Sinseol**. I’ll be staying here for the full eight weeks I’m in Seoul. In this post, I’ll show you my room, the amenities, and where the hotel is located on the map.  

## The Hotel
The hotel is called **Mangrove**. They have multiple locations across the country, and I’m staying at their branch in Sinseol.

## The Room
I have a *Single* room on the 10th floor. It manages to fit a bed, closet, desk, small chair, and bathroom into about ~15m². That might sound tiny, but there are plenty of shelves and drawers to store all your stuff.

Later this week I’m thinking of buying new bedsheets and some plants to bring a bit more color into the room.

## The Amenities
Mangrove provides a variety of amenities for guests.  

### Toiletries
You can grab fresh towels from the amenities closet on the first floor. They also stock toilet paper and garbage bags if you run out.  

### Communal Kitchens
Every two floors, there’s a communal kitchen you can use freely. Signs everywhere remind you to clean up after yourself. The kitchens are well-equipped with air fryers, rice cookers, water purifiers, pots, pans, and cutlery—but no dishwashers.  

My room is right across from one of the kitchens. Whenever I leave or enter, I take a peek inside, but it’s usually empty. I did see some people cooking together on the 8th floor once. Personally, I’ve only used it so far to slice apples and grab plates.

### Laundry Machines
Every four floors you’ll find laundry rooms with several machines. All the buttons are in Korean, so operating them is a little trickier than you’d expect.

### Lounge
On the top floor there’s a lounge with a big communal table, a small coffee bar, and a balcony. When I checked it out on a Tuesday around 1 PM, it was completely empty.

### Gym
The basement has a small gym. It’s functional but not really equipped for extensive workouts.

### Basement
On the same floor as the gym, there are also co-working desks. I’ve seen people working there occasionally, and there’s a large copier as well.

### Mangrove Social Club
Mangrove also hosts community events for guests—things like dinners, talks from local artists, live music, or running classes. These events are spread across their different locations, but you can attend regardless of where you’re staying. I’m planning to join some to meet more people.  

## The Guests
I mostly run into other guests in the elevators, since the communal areas are often quiet. Based on these brief encounters, here’s how I’d break down the demographics:  

### 50% Native Koreans
Surprisingly, about half the guests seem to be Korean. Mangrove offers packages for long stays, and I can see why locals would rent here with all the amenities. Some might be studying at the nearby university, while others might be saving money before moving somewhere more private.  

The Korean guests vary a lot in age. Some are students, some are working adults, and I’ve even seen a few **아줌마 (ajumma)** and **아저씨 (ahjussi)** in the elevators.  

### 25% Tourists
About a quarter look like tourists—easy to spot by their big backpacks, maps, and the fact that they usually travel in pairs.  

### 25% Digital Nomads
The rest seem to be digital nomads, probably staying much longer than I am. They’re here for the same kind of experience as me, just on a different timeline.  

## The Location
The location is fantastic! While it’s a bit outside the city center, the public transit connections make it super convenient.  

From my room, I can see the entrance to **Sinseol Metro Station**, which serves both Line 1 and Line 2. That makes it easy to get almost anywhere in Seoul. Several buses also stop right outside.  

Between the hotel and the station there are:  
- 2 convenience stores  
- 3 street vendors selling snacks  
- An ATM  
- A coffee shop 
- A Norea-bang (Karaoke room) 

Head away from the main roads, and you’ll find a maze of small restaurants, cafés, and even more convenience stores.

## Wrapping Up
All in all, Mangrove Sinseol has been a great base for my first week in Seoul. The room may be compact, but it’s cozy and has everything I need. With all the amenities, public transit right outside, and plenty of food options nearby, it feels like I picked the right spot for this trip.  

I’m looking forward to exploring more of the city and getting to know the other hotel-guests, but it’s nice to know I have a comfortable place to return to at the end of each day.
