# The Written Rules
Asian countries are known for their rules. But unlike Japan, where most of the rules are implicit, Koreans will *tell* you about them — constantly. Everywhere you look, there are signs reminding you what you are **not** allowed to do.  
The word they often use is **금지** (*geumji*), meaning *banned* or *forbidden*.  

I find the abundance of these signs pretty funny, so I started collecting them for you. If I find more, I’ll add them to this post!  

## Standard Signs
Let’s start off with some of the common ones.

<Img 2 desc="The sign on the right says 'It is completely forbidden to litter here!'">  

<Img 8 desc="At the bus stop. I don’t know when the bus will arrive, but at least I know I’m not allowed to smoke or eat here.">  

<Img 3 desc="A sign telling you not to cross the highway — located *right* above a pedestrian tunnel.">  

## A Forbidden Smorgasbord
When there are multiple things that are forbidden, they don’t hold back — you get a full menu of rules.

## Not Forbidden, but Just Really Ominous
Some signs don’t forbid anything… but their English translations can be quite scary.
