# The Written Rules

Asian countries are known for their rules. But unlike Japan, where many are unspoken, Koreans will _tell_ you about them—constantly. Everywhere you look, there are signs reminding you what you are **not** allowed to do.  
The word they often use is **금지** (_geumji_), meaning _banned_ or _forbidden_.

I find the abundance of these signs pretty funny, so I started collecting them for you. If I find more, I’ll add them to this post!

## Standard Signs

Let’s start off with some of the common ones.

<Img 5 desc="It is forbidden to walk on the grass – To prevent safety accidents and protect the lawn, we prohibit access to the lawn.">

<Img 2 desc="The sign on the right says 'It is completely forbidden to litter here!'">

<Img 8 desc="At the bus stop. I don’t know when the bus will arrive, but at least I know I’m not allowed to smoke or eat here.">

<Img 3 desc="A sign telling you not to cross the highway, placed right above a pedestrian tunnel.">

<Img f-8 desc="'If we put it near this pretty statue, people will at least look at it.'">

## No Parking

The sign I see most often by far is **주차금지**: _No Parking_. They love to put this everywhere!

<Img f-3 desc="Just in a random street.">

<Img f-5 desc="I guess you can't park on the left, but leaving your bike on the right is fine?">

<Img f-2 desc="Definitely no parking here!">

<Img f-6 desc="On a manhole cover in the street, like it’s a national slogan.">

## A Forbidden Smorgasbord

When there are multiple things that are forbidden, they don’t hold back—you get a full menu of rules.

<Img 6 desc="The collection in the metro, clearly displaying all the rules. They even added cartoon characters to soften the blow.">

<Img 4 desc="Right before entering the park, you’re reminded of everything you’re not allowed to do.">

<Img f-7 desc="This one’s near a grocery store, showing what not to do on the escalator – the title says 'Moving Walk Usage Information.'">

<Img f-4 desc="A special one for dogs!">

## Not Forbidden, but Just Really Ominous

Some signs don’t forbid anything, but their English translations can be quite ominous.

<Img 7 desc="You can check out, but you can never leave.">
