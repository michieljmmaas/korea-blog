I’ve spent the last 8 weeks — with some small breaks — here in Seoul. I went on many different adventures, met great people, and ate some incredible food. Now that I’m leaving, let’s look back. Here are my 5 favourite days I’ve spent here. I’m mostly talking about the *specific* days; I’ll share my general thoughts in another blogpost.  

In chronological order:

## 2025-10-04: Visiting Suwon
I really enjoyed my visit to Suwon. I loved walking past the remains of the old fortress, exploring the museums, and visiting the Hwaseong Palace. There was a cultural festival happening, so lots of people were dressed in traditional garb, and there were extra events and booths everywhere.

But the highlight for me was the Nam June Paik Art Center. He has become my favourite artist lately. I find his work incredibly interesting and engaging. I wandered around the museum until closing time, and they even gave me a free book with the artworks at the end. As a bonus, I caught a bus right outside that took me straight back to my hotel.

Most of what I did that day were things I had never experienced before in Korea, which made me feel like a *real* tourist again.

## 2025-10-12: Hiking Bukhansan
My most emotional day was hiking Bukhansan. It had been raining a lot in Seoul, and I finally found a day without rain. “Clear” is a stretch though — the summit was so misty I couldn’t see more than five meters ahead. But still, reaching that summit felt like conquering the whole city. I’d had a hard time adjusting to this new environment, finding my routine and rhythm, but standing at the top, it all melted away.

On the way down I finally got to enjoy the views, and when I reached the base I ate a two-person portion of 부대찌개 to recover.

## 2025-10-18: TWICE Fanmeeting
I had the best luck in the world scoring tickets to TWICE’s 10th Anniversary Fanmeeting. It was another emotional experience — being surrounded by hardcore fans, singing along, laughing at the chaos on stage, and wiping away a few tears at the end.

I wrote a full blogpost about the experience: <Blog fanmeeting desc="Click here!">

## 2025-10-25: Trot Singing Competition
My favourite part of this day was the singing competition. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the different characters come on stage — some singing their hearts out, others bombing so hard people started leaving. I compiled a list of my favourite contestants: <Blog trot-festival desc="Click here!">

On top of that, I had the biggest lunch I’ve ever had, browsed the absurdly packed Seoul Flea Market, saw some interesting art at DDP, and still managed to get some work done. This day was a real winner!

## 2025-10-26: Lotte World & Starcraft
I went to a theme park with Katherine, the friend I met who was staying at the same hotel. It was a bit too busy to go on many rides, but we had fun chatting while waiting in line. That evening, there was also a big StarCraft: Brood War match I wanted to see live. I actually managed to enter even though I missed the ticket sale. Watching that level of expertise — and chatting with the other foreigner I met there — was such a cool experience. Definitely a bucket list item I’m glad I got to check off.

## Honourable Mentions
There were so many fun days here that I felt bad excluding these:

- <Day 15>: Visiting the ARARIO Museum and seeing some amazing modern art  
- <Day 20>: Getting a haircut while only speaking Korean  
- <Day 32>: Visiting Everland with a bunch of strangers  
- <Day 35>: Attending the GeForce Gamer Festival — seeing Jeshan Wong and LE SSERAFIM live!  
- <Day 36>: Walking the streets of Itaewon for Halloween  

These past eight weeks have been incredible. I’ve made so many good memories, and I’m glad I have this blog to document them all!
