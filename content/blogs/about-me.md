Hey, thanks for stopping by my blog! Let me introduce myself!

My name is Michiel (but you can also call me Mike), At the point of writing I’m 29 years old, and I work as a software developer from the Netherlands.

Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me at the gym, watching art-house films, or rolling dice in a Dungeons & Dragons session.

In the start of 2021 I fell deep into Korean culture — from learning the language and watching K-dramas, to cooking Korean food at home and, of course, listening to way too much K-pop.

To celebrate the end of my twenties I went of on workkcation to Seoul, South-Korea. This blog talks chronicals all my experience I had while I was there.
