Hey, thanks for stopping by my blog! Let me introduce myself!

My name is Michiel (but you can also call me Mike), I’m 29, and I work as a software developer from the Netherlands.

Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me at the gym, watching art-house films, or rolling dice in a Dungeons & Dragons session.

About five years ago I fell deep into Korean culture — from learning the language and watching K-dramas, to cooking Korean food at home and, of course, listening to way too much K-pop.

Right now, I’m living in Seoul until **November 19th**. If you’d like to meet up, explore the city together, or just chat about shared interests, feel free to reach out!
