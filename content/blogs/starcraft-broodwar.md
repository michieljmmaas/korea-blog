## Introduction
Esports in Korea is on another level. What football is to Europe, *StarCraft* is to Korea. The *Afreeca Starleague* (ASL) is one of the biggest *StarCraft: Brood War* tournaments in the world, held twice a year and lasting about three months. After weeks of matches, the finals had finally arrived — and I was lucky enough to attend in person.

## The Game
First released in 1998, *StarCraft: Brood War* is over 25 years old and still going strong. It remains one of the most iconic real-time strategy games ever made, famous for its deep mechanics, razor-sharp balance, and competitive scene that refuses to die.
The match-up for this ASL final was **Protoss vs. Zerg** — a classic clash of styles. Protoss armies are sleek and high-tech, with powerful energy-based weapons and units that feel almost divine. Zerg, on the other hand, are biological swarms driven by sheer numbers and overwhelming aggression. It’s a duel between precision and chaos, elegance and raw instinct.

This final was a **best-of-seven** series, with all maps decided in advance. Both players had weeks to prepare specific tactics for each one. The first to win four games would be crowned the new ASL champion.

## The Players
On one side was **sNoW**, the Protoss player — a veteran of the scene and a long-time crowd favorite. Known for his clever strategies and crisp control, he’s been a consistent top performer for years but has never quite managed to take home the ASL trophy.
Facing him was **Soma**, a Zerg player making a strong comeback after a few quiet seasons. Like sNoW, Soma has been in the competitive scene for over a decade, but he too had never won an ASL title. Coming into the finals, Soma held the statistical advantage: Zerg traditionally perform well against Protoss, and this was his best match-up.

## The Venue
The venue was surprisingly small but absolutely packed. Every seat was filled, and the atmosphere buzzed with anticipation. There were more women in attendance than I expected, many sitting in the front rows holding colorful cheering signs for their favorite players.
Tickets had sold out in seconds, but I’d read online that sometimes they let people in if they show up early and ask nicely. When I arrived, I found a small group of other foreigners in the same situation. We started chatting, sharing stories about our favorite players, and instantly bonded over our shared love for *Brood War*.
About twenty minutes after the official start time — once the interviews and pre-show were finished — we were allowed to enter, as long as we stood against the back wall. Between games, we traded thoughts on strategy, what we’d do differently, and who we thought had the mental edge. It felt like being part of a secret club of passionate fans.

## The Match

### Game 1 – 울돌목
A tense opener. This was sNoW’s map pick, but Soma didn’t give him a moment to breathe. The match dragged into the late game, showcasing some of the most advanced units from both sides. After a series of scrappy skirmishes, Soma slowly choked sNoW’s economy, denying him key resources until the Protoss base finally fell.  
**1–0 Soma**

### Game 2 – Dominator
Soma came in with a perfectly planned strategy: an early expansion followed by a devastating Hydralisk timing attack. sNoW wasn’t prepared. The game ended quickly, and Soma’s momentum was undeniable.  
**2–0 Soma**

### Game 3 – Radeon
Both players opened aggressively, but their armies missed each other — leading to a chaotic base trade. sNoW managed to defend his own base with impeccable Psionic Storms, wiping out Soma’s attacking force. With Soma’s economy in shambles, sNoW counterattacked and secured the win.  
**2–1 Soma**

### Game 4 – Polestar
A quick one. Soma launched a sharp early Zergling rush, catching sNoW completely off guard. The Protoss defenses collapsed within minutes, and the Zerg swarm flooded the base.  
**3–1 Soma**

### Game 5 – Metropolis
Back on one of his own map picks, sNoW adjusted his play. The larger map favored longer, macro-heavy games rather than quick rushes. He built a balanced army of Zealots and Dragoons, learning from his earlier defeats. After a series of clean skirmishes, sNoW took control of the map and closed it out confidently.  
**3–2 Soma**

### Game 6 – Knockout
Soma looked completely prepared. He chose a big map and went for a patient, macro-oriented game, constantly harassing sNoW’s bases to keep him on the defensive. sNoW tried to fight back, but his economy never recovered. When he finally pushed out in desperation, Soma was waiting — trapping him in a perfect surround and crushing the army from all sides.  
**4–2 Soma**
Soma had done it. After years of chasing the title, he was finally the ASL champion.

## Ending
After the final GG, the stage erupted in cheers. First came the runner-up ceremony — fans rushed forward to hand sNoW bouquets of flowers, showing their admiration for his performance. Then Soma took the stage to thunderous applause. Fireworks went off as he lifted the trophy high, kissed it, and stood there grinning, soaking in his long-awaited moment of glory.

## Behind the Scenes
It was fascinating to watch the production crew in action. Camera operators darted around to capture reactions, and the massive crane camera swung above the audience looking for the perfect crowd shot. As the final moments approached, I noticed stage managers signaling frantically to one another — cueing the lights, music, and confetti for the winner’s celebration. It all felt tightly choreographed yet full of genuine emotion.

## The Experience
Being there in person was unforgettable. To witness a *StarCraft: Brood War* final — in Seoul, of all places — felt surreal. Even though I didn’t have a ticket, just managing to get in, sharing the experience with new friends, and feeling the energy of the crowd gave me chills. After more than two decades, this old game still brings people together from all over the world. And for one night, I got to be part of that magic.
