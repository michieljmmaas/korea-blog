## The Game

Chess but 60 miles an hour. 
Real time stratgegt game. 





## The players.

Soma was favorite, with a higher win percentage. 


## The Venue
Quite small. but packed ot the brim. The were more girld in attendance than you might expect, all placed at the first two row.,s 


## Gane 1 - 

Tight match. Snows pick but sooma was didn't give him room to breath. 

It want the long way, and we got so see some late game untis.

Many interesctions. but soma was able to choke sNoW out. 

## Game 2 

Snow had i al tought out. early hatcher and a big timing push. 

SNow wasn't prepared for this. It was a quick end. 

It wans't looking good for sNoW at this point

## Game 3

More aggresive, turned into a base race.

samo had to pull back after a good defense and some excelent storms against. 


The got back on the board.


## Game 4

Early zerg rush. 

3-1


## Game 5
larger map, again in sNoW's pick. 

With ballanced play, and able to amassa big army, he was able to put on a defense. 
Learning from his previous mistakes. 

## Game 6 

Again soma was well prepared for this mathc. 
picking a large map, and focussing on a macro play. 

Constant haress and engagemnet was slowing sNoW doing in the macro game. 

No time to build new expansions as he had to put all his resources in to defending against the constat onslaught of zerg units. 

A desprerate attempt by snow to regain a foothold, was right soma was waiting for. he traped snow in a perfect acounter, surround the eneemy from multiple fronts. 




## Ending
Prize ceremony and awards. 


## Behind the scenes


It was cool so the behind the scenes too, of people running around trying to save things.

Like when the final match was comming to a close i could see the stage manager signaling each other. 

The big cranes with the camera's hoveering over.
