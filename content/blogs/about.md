This blog is mainly for myself—a place to look back on my trip and reminisce about all the exciting things I did.  

It’s also a way to keep my family, friends, and colleagues updated on my adventures.  

# How to read this blog

There are three types of posts: **Daily posts**, **Weekly posts**, and **Blogs**.  

## Daily Posts
I’ll try to upload a short post every day with a quick description of what I did, some photos, and a few fun statistics.  

Read these if you want a quick update on my day-to-day activities.  

You can find them on the **Grid** section.  

## Weekly Posts
At the end of every week (Friday → Thursday), I’ll post a longer recap covering the highlights and giving more detail about what I experienced.  

These are the best posts to read if you want a full picture of my trip week by week.  

You can find them in the **Weeks** section.  

## Blogs
From time to time, I’ll write blog posts on specific topics—like my accommodation, Korean culture, or special events.  

Read these if you’re interested in deeper dives or my thoughts on particular subjects.  

You can find them in the **Blogs** section.  

## Food
I also have a list of Foods I want to eat. When I have tried the food I will give it a score out of 5, and upload a picture of it. 

You can find them in the **Food** section.  

## Goals
Lastly, I have some goals I want to achieve while I am in South Korea. I will cover the goals with a standard blogpost. 

You can find them in the **Goals** section.
