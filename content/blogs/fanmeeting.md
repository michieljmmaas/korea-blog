I got the very special oppertunity to attend TWICE's 10th aniversary fanmeeting. This might be one of the coolest events for a TWICE fan to attend live. It more then three hours of songs, fanservice and affirmations of love mutal between TWICE and ONCE. 

I'll tell you about what went into it, the fans, the gear and ofcourse the show itsself. I'll be using pictures I took my self, pictures I found on social media and some screengrabs from the livestream. 


## How do TWICE Fanmeetings work?
A fanmeeting is different from a concert. Instead of just playing music the members tell storiesm play games and they tell the fans how much they mean to them. TWICE excells at this fan service. They have multiple songs dedicated to their fans, like [ONE IN A MILLION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA41_pkBL50), which is also part of their greeting, referring to the small change they had of becomming kpop starts, and [21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsmSi4avq-0) referencing "To once, from TWICE (9 members)" with the members writing their own lyrics expressing their love for their fans. They also have hours of content uploaded on their youtube channel where they play games together, solves escape rooms go on 'friend-dates' for their fans to gobble up.  

This is offcourse all part of their marketing strategy to strengthen the parasocial bond the fans have to the artist, but with TWICE I find it hard to find where they kayfabe ends. Also, as a fan, it is way more fun believing the sugary sweet words instead of being cynical about it. 

You might wonder: why go to a concert when they don't even play that many songs? But it is not about the songs. It is about being with together with other die-hard fans, and having a special bonding moment with the artists you all admire. Seeing the members interact with eachother, and have funs make a happy. I saw a Japanese fan write online:

> These 9 women truly love eachother, and that love overflows onto ONCE

<Img love desc="Not only co-workers, but actually friends?">

Even the name of the event, 10VE UNIVERSE, uses the number of years they have been together to write the world LOVE. They use uses these kinds of  have have lose of these corny names.   

TWICE actualy debut dat is October 20th 2025. This is really close to Halloween, so in previous of their fanmeeting they dressed up in Halloween costumes. But after the tragic crowdcrush event in 2022, doing this so openly is seen in bad taste. Ever since they have chosen to choose a single concept and stick to it, like last year it was Baseball themed. This years theme is Time-capusule (which you send into outerspace / the universe I guess?). The fans are encourgaed to dress up tough, and they did a great jon! 

### The Guests
Among the attendees where many mini-celebraties from inside the fandom. There were famous fan-accounts admins (people collectie TWICE content, translate it and share it with the fans), fan-art artists and fan-fiction writers. The friends and family of the idols were also in attendence, there was a line forming of people wanting to take a picture with Sana's parents. I saw people from many different counties, ages and backgrounds. I even believe I saw the person I was seated next to on the flight back from Macau, that was rewatching videos from that concert.    

There were also a lot of people dressing up as their favourite TWICE moments from the past 10 years!

### TWIVELY - The TWICE Mascots
You might have spotted some of the TWIVELY's already. These are the TWICE Mascots. There are 10 of them, one for TWICE as a whole, and the on for each member in their respective colors. The TWICE logo also has specific colors (Apricot and Pink). These colors where chosen my the company on debut, and the exact color hex codes where shared so that fans can create their own fan content for them.

They started this trend in Japan, where TWICE is the most popular, but it has since bleed out to other regions. People collect the TWIVELY's of their favorite member and display them proudly.

### Candy Bong - The TWICE Lightstick 
Another Item every fan must have it a Candy Bong. This is a lightstick, that you can wave around during the a concert. They are around 30cm tall, and have a multicolored LED at the top. Once you turn them on they automatically connect to a bluetooth central hub, and are then controller remotely so the colors a light up in the style during the concert. Is it really nice to have something like this you can swing around during a concert instead of just sitting on your chair. For the performers this is also a nice thing, the venue can be quite dark when they are performing, having those lights in the crowd is a cool touch.

And ofcourse you can also buy accessories for you Candy Bong to dress it up.

## The Location - The Tiger Dome
The event was hosted at the Tiger Dome. The gymnasium of Korea University. It only has a capacity of ~6000, which many fans said was way too small. They had decorated it with big posters.
