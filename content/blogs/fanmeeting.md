I got the very special oppertunity to attend TWICE's 10th aniversary fanmeeting. This might be one of the coolest events for a TWICE fan to attend live. It more then three hours of songs, fanservice and affirmations of love mutal between TWICE and ONCE. 

I'll tell you about what went into it, the fans, the gear and ofcourse the show itsself. I'll be using pictures I took my self, pictures I found on social media and some screengrabs from the livestream. 


## How do TWICE Fanmeetings work?
A fanmeeting is different from a concert. Instead of just playing music the members tell storiesm play games and they tell the fans how much they mean to them. TWICE excells at this fan service. They have multiple songs dedicated to their fans, like [ONE IN A MILLION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA41_pkBL50), which is also part of their greeting, referring to the small change they had of becomming kpop starts, and [21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsmSi4avq-0) referencing "To once, from TWICE (9 members)" with the members writing their own lyrics expressing their love for their fans. They also have hours of content uploaded on their youtube channel where they play games together, solves escape rooms go on 'friend-dates' for their fans to gobble up.  

This is offcourse all part of their marketing strategy to strengthen the parasocial bond the fans have to the artist, but with TWICE I find it hard to find where they kayfabe ends. Also, as a fan, it is way more fun believing the sugary sweet words instead of being cynical about it. 

You might wonder: why go to a concert when they don't even play that many songs? But it is not about the songs. It is about being with together with other die-hard fans, and having a special bonding moment with the artists you all admire. Seeing the members interact with eachother, and have funs make a happy. I saw a Japanese fan write online:

> These 9 women truly love eachother, and that love overflows onto ONCE

<Img love desc="Not only co-workers, but actually friends?">

Even the name of the event, 10VE UNIVERSE, uses the number of years they have been together to write the world LOVE. They use uses these kinds of  have have lose of these corny names.   

TWICE actualy debut dat is October 20th 2025. This is really close to Halloween, so in previous of their fanmeeting they dressed up in Halloween costumes. But after the tragic crowdcrush event in 2022, doing this so openly is seen in bad taste. Ever since they have chosen to choose a single concept and stick to it, like last year it was Baseball themed. This years theme is Time-capusule (which you send into outerspace / the universe I guess?). The fans are encourgaed to dress up tough, and they did a great jon! 

### The Guests
Among the attendees where many mini-celebraties from inside the fandom. There were famous fan-accounts admins (people collectie TWICE content, translate it and share it with the fans), fan-art artists and fan-fiction writers. The friends and family of the idols were also in attendence, there was a line forming of people wanting to take a picture with Sana's parents. I saw people from many different counties, ages and backgrounds. I even believe I saw the person I was seated next to on the flight back from Macau, that was rewatching videos from that concert.    

There were also a lot of people dressing up as their favourite TWICE moments from the past 10 years!

### TWIVELY - The TWICE Mascots
You might have spotted some of the TWIVELY's already. These are the TWICE Mascots. There are 10 of them, one for TWICE as a whole, and the on for each member in their respective colors. The TWICE logo also has specific colors (Apricot and Pink). These colors where chosen my the company on debut, and the exact color hex codes where shared so that fans can create their own fan content for them. 

<Img twively desc="A chart of all te TWIVELY's">

They started this trend in Japan, where TWICE is the most popular, but it has since bleed out to other regions. People collect the TWIVELY's of their favorite member and display them proudly.

### Candy Bong - The TWICE Lightstick 
Another Item every fan must have it a Candy Bong. This is a lightstick, that you can wave around during the a concert. They are around 30cm tall, and have a multicolored LED at the top. Once you turn them on they automatically connect to a bluetooth central hub, and are then controller remotely so the colors a light up in the style during the concert. Is it really nice to have something like this you can swing around during a concert instead of just sitting on your chair. For the performers this is also a nice thing, the venue can be quite dark when they are performing, having those lights in the crowd is a cool touch.

And ofcourse you can also buy accessories for you Candy Bong to dress it up.

## The Location - The Tiger Dome
The event was hosted at the Tiger Dome. The gymnasium of Korea University. It only has a capacity of ~6000, which many fans said was way too small. They had decorated it with big posters. 

<Img venue desc="The venue, all decorated">

# The Show
The show it self was filled with:
- fan favorite songs, some of which haven't been performed live in years
- Telling funny stories that haven't been shared before
- Playing interactive games
- And many hearthelt messages     

## Act I - The Hits
The started with [TWICE SONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeeXDO--cs), which isn't as much a song as a kneamatic device to remember their names. It was origianlly created for a TV show they were part of, joking about how many members they had. So it is not realy part of their discography but a fan favorute none the less. Everyone knew the lyrics by heart at this point.

<Img 1 desc="Starting your 10th year anniversry show of with this song is such a flex.">

After that they did 'Talk That Talk' and 'This is For', songs that do really well with crowds. The fireworks where a nice touch! 

<Img 2 desc="The view from my seat">


The did their introductions, and introduced the rest of the show to come. 

<Img 3 desc="Even Sana couldn't take this level of corneyness serious">

The performed Stategy, and then went of stage for the first costume change. In the meantime they played a video package. It started of as an old timey tape playing their personal introductions from their time in Sixteen, more then 10 years ago. But after it became clear that it wasn't the original tape, but instead a short for shot remake! 


<Img 4 desc="A real trip down memory lane">

## Act II - Story Time
After come back out in new outfit they started with 'Like Ooh-ahh', their debut song. Performing with the same energy they did so long ago. 

<Img 5 desc="They must be so sick of this song, but the fan's can't get enough of it!">

Then some seats came out, and the more casual part of the show begane. The production crew had prepared a few old photo's and videos which were showed to the members, and they started talking about their memories. There was one really funny story about the time they barged into Nayeon’s room at midnight to celebrate her birthday, only to find her gone. They had filmed themselves singing Happy Birthday to her empty bed, placeing the cake there, blowing out the candles and then eating the cake themselves.  

Fans were also allowed to submit photo's of their own memories they have of TWICE. They showed a fan's collection (26!) of concert banners, all still in prestine condition, another fan sent in a picture of here collection of twice stickers she made when she was 12, 8 years later she was still there in the audience. 

<Img 6 desc="The banners span the whole decade!">

After that they played BDZ, originally a made for their japanese discography, but it got so popular they translated it back into Korean. THey followed it up with Knock-Kock, which at the start has a section an improve section, which was used to wish our selves a happy 10th aniversarry. 

<Img 7 desc="The crowd roared!">

## Act III - Game Time
Now it was time for games! This might seem like a waste of time for a concert, but this was actually my favorite part of the concert. Seeing the members interact with each other fills my heart with joy! The can be really funny, as some of the members get a little bit too ambitious, while others are just a bit too clumsey. 

They started of with “Shouting in Silence”  where members wear noise-canceling headphones and try to lip-read each other in relay. It simple game, but always a success! 

<Img 8 desc="Momo was trying her best here!">

Sana messed up pretty bad one round, and messed it all up for the group. Afterwards they asked the crowd where they went wrong, and every started point at Sana, after which she got really sulky. 

<Img 9 desc="After this round she was put first in the queue so she couldn't mess up anymore">

The also did a dance relay, which is the same game, but instead relaying a phrase, it is a part of choreography. They did multiple rounds of this, all of which were succesfull. One round was the 귀요미송 (Cutie song). Sort of a nursey rhyme that got popular because of how cute you can perform it. This is called 얘교 (appearing cute to others) and is very popular among kpop acts, but by the time your older then 20 it has hard to do without cringing. The choreography is really is to recognize, but all the members in the relay asked the person in front of them to perform it in full just the embarrsem the more infront of the fans. When Mina finally got the right answer they played the introduction graphic, which was Jihyo performing it at a radio show almost 10 years ago. When Jihyo saw herself performing the fell to her knees out of embrassement. 

<Img 10 desc="The things Idols have to go through to get radio play">

The concluded this with a photoshoot with props cute props as a nice button on this section.  In total they spend about an hour (a third of the event) playing games and hanging around. For my part it could have 90%, and I still would have enjoyed it hell out of this event.

## Act IV - Sentimental Ballads
When they were done playing the played some deep cut. 'Like a Fool' and'Depend on you'. During that last song fans were asked to throw the paper airplanes towards the stage. Upon entry of the venue all fans were giving a piece of paper, on which they were encourged to write a sentimental message of what TWICE means to them. Most of the paper airplanes didn't reach the stage, but the it was a nice sight sing all those places fly, filled with outpourings of emotions.  

<Img 12 desc="See all these stories go!">

AFter the performance they picked some of the up. 

* "You were part of my youth, which made it so amazingly bright"
* "You made such bright memories for us, and we wish for your happiness"
* "TWICE is my past, present and future"

The then performed 'Some one like me', and when back stage for the last costume change/ 

## Act V - Fan Service
After the video package had finished the members came back out for a fan walk. Circling the gymnasium to greet fans up close. I was seated in the third row of the second tier, and they passed right by me! 

<Img 13 desc="J've never been this close them before!">

The greeted fans, waved to friends and family of theirs in the crowed an finally got back on the stage togher. All while perfoming "Going Crazy" and "Truth". 

When they got back on stage it was time to point the camera at the crowd. A few best cosplayers in the crowd were highlighted and put on the jumbotron. 

TWICE then continued on, expressing their love for ONCE. Nayeon asked the crowd "If you are reincarnated, would you be a ONCE again?". She got her answer pretty quickly. A histerical fan stood up and shouted, loud enough for the entire gymnasium to hear: "I will live forever, and I will be a ONCE forever!". This was so loud that that it got the attention from the members, eventually a spotlight was shone upon him, while he was pourning it heart out. 

<Img 14 desc="Honestly dude, same">

## Act VI - The Video Package
Finally, a highlight video played, chronicling TWICE’s ten-year journey—the highs, lows, and triumphs. Watching it hit me hard; I could map their timeline to my own life as a fan for the past six years. I saw not only their career, but my past decade right beside it. I placed my struggles next to heir, and how I was able to overcome it with the joy the gave me. I then looked around me and saw the multiple people were tearing up having those exact some feelings, not be ofcourse I just had some dust in my eyes. 

Seeing the Video package TWICE members where at a loss of words, and tearing up. The whole audience started chanting *“사랑해!”* (“We love you!”) and *“행복해!”* ("We are so happy!”). 

<Img 15 desc="Not a dry eye the be seen">

They rolled out a birthday cake, and we sang Happy Birthday together. 

As a final song they played Me+You. Their fans song they has released only last week. This time was able to sing along to the fanchats, as I had practed them earlier during lunch. It was such a cool feeling to be in unison with all these other fans, showing our devotion to TWICE.

## Act VII - No, you hang up!
The show had reached the three hour mark, so it was time to wrap up. TWICE said their final goodbyes, but not wanting to leave yet they decided on performing one more encore song. They put it up to a vote for the fans, but everyone was cheering for their favorite song. 

They ended up going with "Knock-Knock", and a 2025 version of Jihyo doing the 귀요미송 from earlier, against her own protests ("Oh no, my parents are in the audience tonight").  

<Img 16 desc="This woman is 28 years old">


After they were done the fans shouted kept shouting 'ENCORE, ENCORE', so they performed 'Going crazy' again, then finally closed the show after saying goodbye to all the people watching the livesteam at home. 

<Img 17 desc="Bye, bye!">

## Act VIII - The sweet gift
After the show had ended, it took some time for people to leave the gymnasium. People were still in bliss, and soaking everything in. Others were taking pictures with the stage and chatting with the cosplayers that were features on the jumbo tron, who had turned into mini celebraties in the mean time. 

Upon leaving the venue all fans were given a cinnemon roll and some a drink packets. A simple but kind gesture. 

<Img 18 desc="How sweet!">

## Act IX - The aftermath
Outside, fans were crying, hugging, and singing together. Some arranged their lightsticks on the ground to form the TWICE logo. People weren't ready to let go if this feeling, and wanted to profess their support for TWICE even after they had left the building. That energy I felt inside the gymnasium, I felt it here too, but multipled by seeing everyones faces and actions. Everyone was savering that feeling, for how good it felt.

# How did I experience it?

A year ago I was watching the Livestream of their 9th year anniversary. Nearing the end Jihyo turned to the screen and said "And those watching on Beyond LIVE, you should come too!". I hopefully said "Yes, I will!". I've had plans for this trip for so long that point I didn't know if I was able to actually do this trip, let alone get tickets for event. I had planned it to coincide with their 10th year anniversary celebration, so attending it would make this all very special. I was expecting to miss out on the tickets, giving the small venue size and hte facting I had just landed after a 11 hour flight and was using Lottera wifi, a tablet and a dream (see <Day 1>). 

I also didn't expect to get so emotional during this event. During the video package package that should their store the last 10 years, I realized this event was just their 10th year anniversary, but also mine. That their struggles and victories were always fought along side eachother. They might not know it, but they have helped me through some rough times, and filled love life with some much join. 

Walking back to the metro, I couldn't stop thinking of what Jihyo said a year ago. "You should come too!". Attending the fanmeeting was probably my biggest wish of this whole trip, but I never dared speaking it for the more likely case of missing this event entirely. I know know what it feels like, when your dreams come true.
