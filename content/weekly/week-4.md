## Time Flies When You Are Having Fun
This is already the **fourth week** I‚Äôve been here! So far, I‚Äôve seen TWICE live (twice!), climbed a mountain, visited countless museums, and met some great people. I‚Äôm speaking more and more Korean to get around, spending less time glued to my phone for directions, and eating out like the locals do. This whole experience has truly been one of a kind.  

## The Peaks
Last week was packed, but I had an amazing time! Let‚Äôs go over some highlights.  

### TWICE Anniversary Celebrations
On <Mon>, TWICE celebrated their 10th debut anniversary. For the occasion, they organized a whole range of events ‚Äî most of which I managed to attend. I watched their Anniversary Eve livestream on <Sun>, went to their movie on <Mon>, and visited their pop-up store on <Wed>.  

Then, on <Sat>, I had the incredible opportunity to attend their special 10th anniversary fan meeting. It was such an unforgettable experience ‚Äî [I wrote a full blog post about it here](../blogs/fanmeeting)!  

Being in Seoul for this celebration really felt like living every ONCE‚Äôs dream. Now that the festivities are over and they‚Äôre heading back on tour, expect a bit more of my usual ‚Äúdaily life‚Äù posts ‚Äî though rest assured, their songs are still playing on loop every day.

### New Schedule is Working (Out) Great
I‚Äôve changed up my daily rhythm a bit. Last week I noticed how easy it is to overwork myself if I don‚Äôt take proper breaks. Now I start each day by writing my blog post for the previous day, make sure to head outside for lunch, and take my workout break *on time* (well‚Ä¶ mostly).  

It‚Äôs made such a difference. Taking breaks consistently helps me conserve energy throughout the day and gives me more life *during* work instead of after it. As a bonus, it also means trying more foods from my list!

### Dining Out More
I feel like I‚Äôve completely gotten over the ‚Äúdining alone‚Äù hurdle I had at the start of this trip. The restaurant food here is just too good to miss out on. Every day around lunch, I pick a dish I still want to try for dinner and look for a nearby restaurant that serves it.  

I‚Äôve gotten good at spotting single portions on menus, and I don‚Äôt feel awkward anymore ordering for just myself. It‚Äôs actually become something I really enjoy.

### Having Friends
Having friends helps a lot with eating out too! So far, I think I‚Äôve got *two*!  

I met **Katherine** at the Digital Nomads drinks event on <Day 14>, and she happens to live in the same hotel. We‚Äôve gone out for dinner twice already and are planning to make it a weekly tradition. We keep each other posted during the week and share tips for things to do around Seoul. We‚Äôre planning a trip to **Lotte World** on Sunday (<Day 31>).  

Then, on <Tue>, I had a **Bumble date** with Sooyeon. The evening turned into a fun, in-depth conversation about Korean culture. I got to ask all the questions I‚Äôd been holding onto since arriving, and learned a ton. She even invited me to join her and some friends for a theme park trip next Monday (<Day 32>)!

### Doing My Democratic Duty
All week I‚Äôve been listening to podcasts, interviews, and debates about the Dutch elections. I‚Äôm a bit of a politics nerd, so it‚Äôs been such a treat to follow along. While programming I‚Äôve been mixing work and and politcs all week.  

I wrote about who I‚Äôm voting for ([Dani√´lle Hirsch ‚Äî #23 for GroenLinks-PvdA](https://groenlinkspvda.nl/onze-mensen/kandidaten-tk25/danielle-hirsch-2/)) on <Sun> and dropped off my ballot at the Dutch Embassy on <Mon>, which I thoroughly enjoyed doing.  

<Img voting desc="I filled in my ballot with a red pen of course!">

## The Valleys
Not everything went perfectly last week ‚Äî here‚Äôs what didn‚Äôt go so smoothly.  

### Missing Out on Tickets, Again!
I‚Äôve been having *terrible* luck with tickets this trip (with one glorious exception, of course). I missed out on TWICE tickets for Taiwan (both days), TWICE tickets for their second day in Macau, and this week ‚Äî MAMA tickets and the StarCraft tournament on Sunday.  

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm late ‚Äî I set reminders, alarms, and sit ready at the exact moment they go live. But still, no luck so far.  

For the StarCraft tournament, I‚Äôll try asking nicely if I can enter without a ticket and just stand in the back (I read online that the sometimes let people do that). If that doesn‚Äôt work, I still have the StarCraft exhibtions match on <Day 35> (I did get tickets for that one). I‚Äôll also try to get MAMA tickets from a reseller, but I am kind worried about a repeat of last time.

### Working Remotely Can Be Pretty Inconvenient
I‚Äôm really lucky to be able to work remotely like this. In the mornings, I focus on programming, and in the afternoons, I handle meetings. But since the overlap with my colleagues is only a few hours a day, I often have to cram every meeting into that small window ‚Äî and if something gets delayed, it pushes everything back a whole day.  

Even trickier is when I run into an issue in the morning that I can‚Äôt solve on my own. I just have to wait until everyone else wakes up before I can get feedback.  

I‚Äôve found ways to manage ‚Äî like picking up smaller tasks in the meantime and communicating extra clearly ‚Äî but this comming weekend the time difference will grow by another hour, which will complicate things further.

## What‚Äôs Next?
Next week‚Äôs shaping up to be really exciting! I‚Äôll have to work some unconventional hours to make time for everything, but it‚Äôll be worth it. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming up:  

- <Day 29>: Running **Bridge-to-Bridge**, and I want to get some drinks in Hongdae 
- <Day 30>: Visiting the **flea market** near my hotel  
- <Day 31>: **Lotte World** with Katherine (and maybe the ASL finals? ü§û)  
- <Day 32>: **Everland** with Sooyeon and her friends  
- <Day 35>: **GeForce Gamer Festival** ‚Äî StarCraft Exhibition Match + **LE SSERAFIM** performance!  
- <Day 36>: **Halloween party** in Itaewon  

Four weeks down, and somehow, it feels like I‚Äôve only just arrived. Time really does fly when you‚Äôre having fun.
