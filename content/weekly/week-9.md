Mind Dump: Rest will come later.

I keep forgetting that I am on vacation now, because I have been doing that hybrid thing for so long. But I feel like I am getting the hang of it again.

Taiwan was fun—more fun than I expected it to be. I found the culture really interesting, very unfamiliar to me. The art was great too, and the temples were a nice sight. 

But not everything was fun. 

## Hills:

### Alishan Park
The nature was great, and the sights were beautiful! Definitely worth all the travel hassle.

### The Modern Art
The Modern Art museum was great. It was different from what I am used to, with a lot of interactive pieces and videos, but I loved it.

### I was okay with missing the TWICE Concert
Seeing all the TWICE stuff in Kaohsiung felt like they were kind of rubbing it in my face that I missed out on the tickets. Seeing all the other ONCEs walking around, and hearing their music blasted in all the stores. 

I thought I would be really sad, but in the end I was okay with it. I had already seen them in Macao, and at the fan meeting, and when I saw what they performed, I understood that the concert wasn’t for me, but for the Taiwanese fans instead. I was fine with it.

### Learning about the culture was fun!
I learned so much about Taiwanese culture and history. It was so interesting to me. While walking through the museums I kept wondering, “How does that work?” and I spent the evenings watching YouTube videos about it and reading Wikipedia / asking ChatGPT.

### Energy levels were good!
I made some long days and did a lot of things, but my energy levels were good throughout. While in Japan I felt a lot more tired. Sleeping helps, I learned.

## The Valleys

### The Food
I had some trouble finding food I liked. The signs were hard to read sometimes, and there weren’t really that many things I wanted to eat.

### I felt a bit underprepared
I spent quite a bit of time planning each day in the morning. I heard that is normal, but I didn’t like it all that much. I prefer to have it all written down, so I don’t “waste” time here. 

What I did notice is that I have more context of what is here, so I know better what to adjust and focus on—like seeing what stuff is put on the souvenirs—but I would have rather had it written down before. 

I was happy with how the travel to Alishan worked out in the end.

## What to look forward to?
I have 6 days left, 7 if you count the last day of traveling, for this “work-cation.” I am spending it in Hong Kong. The main reason I am here is because of the MNET Asian Music Awards (MAMA)—the K-pop extravaganza taking place here over the weekend. But I have some other stuff planned too. 

- <Day 64>: MAMA Day 1
- <Day 65>: MAMA Day 2
- <Day 67>: Modern Art Day
- <Day 68>: Hiking the “Dragon’s Back”
- <Day 70>: Flying back home

I thought it would be a very sulky week here in Taiwan. I even thought about cancelling my plans after missing out on the TWICE tickets, but I am glad I didn’t! I had so much fun here. I saw some great sights, learned a lot about the history, and ate some interesting foods. 

I can confidently say: “TAIWAN #1”
