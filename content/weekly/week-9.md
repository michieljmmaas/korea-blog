Mind Dump: Rest will come later.

I keep forgetting that I am on vacation now, because I have doing that hybrid thing for so long now. But I feel like I am getting the hang of it again.

Taiwan was fun, more fun than I expectied it to be. I found the culture to be really interesting, very unfamiliar to me. The art was great too, and temples where a nice sight. 

But not everything was fun. 

## Hills:

### Alisan Park
The nature was great, and the sights were beautiful! Definitly worht all the travel hassle.

### The Modern Art
The Modern Art again was great. It was different from what I am used to, with a lot of interactive pieces and videos, but I loved it.

### I was okay with missing the TWICE Concert
Seeing all the TWICE stuff in Kaoshiung felt like they were kinda rubbing it in my face, that I missed out on the tickets. Seeing all the other ONCEs walking around, and hearing there music blasted in all the stores. 

I thought I would we really sad, but in the end I was okay with it. I had already seen them in Macao, and at the Fanmeeting, and when seeing what they performed, I understoond that the concert wasn't for me, but the Taiwanese fans instead. I was fine with it.

### Learning about the culture was fun!
I learned so much about Taiwanese culture and history. It was so interesting to me. While walking the museums I kept wondering, 'How does that work?' and I spend the evenings watching YouTube videos about it and reading wikipedia / asking ChatGPT.

### Energy levels where good!
I made some long days, and did a lot of things, but my energy levels were good throughout. While in Japan I was a lot more tired I felt. Sleeping helps I learnt.

## The Valleys

### The Food
I has some trouble with finding food I liked. The signs where hard to read some times, and there weren't real that many things that I wanted to eat.

## What to look forward to?
I am now going into the last week of this 'workcation', and I am spending it in Hong Kong. The main reason I am here is because of the MNet Asian Musum Awards (MAMA). The Kpop extravaganza taking place here over the weekend. But I have some other stuff planned too. 

- <Day 64>: MAMA Day 1
- <Day 65>: MAMA Day 2
- <Day 67>: Modern Art Day
- <Day 68>: Hiking the 'Dragon's Back'
- <Day 70>: Flying back Home



I thought I would be very sulky week here in Taiwan, I even thought about cancelling my plans after missing out on the TWICE tickets, but I am glad I didn't! I had so much fun here. I saw some great sights, learned a lot about the history and ate some interesting foods. 

I can confidently say: 'TAIWAN NUMBA ONE'
