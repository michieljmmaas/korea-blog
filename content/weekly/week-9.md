I keep forgetting that I’m on vacation now, probably because I’ve been doing the hybrid work-travel thing for so long. But I finally feel like I’m getting the hang of vacation mode again.

Taiwan was fun — even more fun than I expected. The culture felt fascinating and unfamiliar in the best way. I spend a lot of time reading Wikipedia articles, and talking to ChatGPT, trying to undertand how things work here. The art scene was fantastic, the temples were beautiful, and I loved exploring places I knew almost nothing about before arriving.

But of course, not everything was perfect.

## Hills

### Alishan Park
The nature in Alishan was stunning — misty trees, sweeping views, and quiet trails. Everything was well maintained, which made the hiking a joy. It was definitely worth the long journey to get up there.

### Modern Art Museums
The modern art scene here was a real highlight. It was different from what I’m used to: highly interactive, video-heavy, and full of pieces that encouraged you to touch, move, or immerse yourself in the space. I loved it.

### Missing the TWICE Concert (And Being Okay With It)
Kaohsiung was overflowing with TWICE banners, ads, and fans — a constant reminder that I didn’t manage to get concert tickets. Seeing other ONCEs walking around and hearing TWICE songs blasting from shops should’ve made me sad, but surprisingly… it didn’t.

I’d already seen them in Macao and at the fan meeting, and when I looked at the clips on Twitter afterwards, I realized this concert was tailored for Taiwanese fans. I didn’t feel left out — just happy for them.

### Learning the Culture
I learned so much about Taiwanese culture and history. Every museum visit sparked dozens of questions, and I spent nights watching YouTube videos, reading Wikipedia, and asking ChatGPT to fill in the gaps. It was endlessly interesting.

### Energy Levels: Surprisingly Strong
I made some long days and packed a lot in, but my energy levels stayed great throughout. In Japan, I felt a lot more drained, but here I slept well, ate well, and that made all the difference.

## Valleys

### The Food
I did struggle with food sometimes. Reading signs wasn’t always easy, and a lot of dishes just didn’t appeal to me (so much offal!). I still tried plenty — but some were definitely misses.

### Feeling a Bit Underprepared
A lot of my mornings were spent planning each day, which I know is normal when you are on a vacation, but I’m not a big fan of doing it myself. I prefer having everything written out beforehand so I don’t feel like I’m “wasting” time figuring out what I want to do.

The upside is that the longer I stayed there, the more context I got — like noticing what kinds of things appear on souvenirs, or what neighborhoods are known for. It helped me adjust my plans better, even if I still wish I had sorted it all out earlier.

That said, the transportation to Alishan figured it self out, and I was really grateful for that!

## What’s Next?

I have six — seven if you count the travel day — left in in this “work-cation,” and I’ll be spending them in Hong Kong. The main reason I’m there is the MNET Asian Music Awards (MAMA), the massive K-pop spectacle happening this weekend. But I’ve got other things lined up too:

- **Day 64:** MAMA Day 1  
- **Day 65:** MAMA Day 2  
- **Day 66:** Modern Art Day  
- **Day 67:** Hong Kong Island & Victoria Peak 
- **Day 68:** Hiking the “Dragon’s Back”  
- **Day 70:** Flying home  

I thought I’d be sulky this whole week in Taiwan — I even briefly considered canceling the trip after missing out on TWICE tickets. But I’m so glad I didn’t. I had a wonderful time: I saw beautiful places, learned so much about the culture, and ate some truly *memorable* foods.

I can confidently say: **TAIWAN #1.**
