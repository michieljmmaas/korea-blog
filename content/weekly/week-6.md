Last week wasn’t as eventful as the ones before, but I was bound to run out of things to do here eventually. The joys I had were more subtle this time — but no less meaningful.  

## The Hills

Let’s start with my favorite moments from the week.  

### Time to Contemplate

On <Sat>, I finally took some time to rest and reflect. This trip isn’t just about having fun — it’s also about looking back at the past ten years and thinking ahead to the next decade. I finally managed to sit down, write, and put some of those thoughts into words. Being here has made me more in tune with my emotions, and it’s helped me think about what I truly value.

### Halloween!

It was Halloween on <Fri>, and I tried to make the most of it! My original plan was to go to a big party, but I bailed pretty quickly to meet up with Katherine instead. We spent the night wandering through Itaewon, checking out costumes, doing a bit of dancing, playing arcade games, and ending the night with some free pizza.

### Reliving Memories in Myeongdong

On <Sat>, I visited Myeongdong — the neighborhood where my Airbnb was during my first trip to Seoul. It was surprisingly nostalgic walking those familiar streets, seeing how much had changed, and visiting the same shops. I even stopped by the 7-Eleven where we used to buy kimbap and soju every night, hoping to see the friendly cashier from back then. Unfortunately, she wasn’t working that day, but maybe I’ll try again before I leave.

### Getting Over That Slump

Last week I wrote about “losing that edge” — how things started feeling a bit dull. But after catching up on sleep, I felt that spark again. What I thought was boredom was actually something deeper: I’ve simply grown comfortable here. With a little more than a week left in Seoul, it’s time to make the most of it.

### Hanging Out with Katherine

I’ve really enjoyed spending time with Katherine this week. Having a friend around makes everything a bit lighter — from grabbing food to exploring the city. Since we’re staying at the same hotel, it’s easy to meet up, and we’ve ended up doing a lot together: visiting a theme park, going for long walks, and chatting late into the night.

## The Valleys

Of course, not everything was perfect this week.  

### Hard to Find Time for Important Tasks

Between work and running around the city, I’ve fallen behind on my errands. I like to stay organized, but it’s been hard to find time. My trips to Taiwan and Hong Kong are comming up soon. Most of the stuff is aleady sorted — tickets booked, hotels reserved, itineraries planned — but I still want to go over everything again, and write down a few more thoughts before I go. I feel there is still so much prep I need to do, an so little time.

### Stress at Work

Work has been stressful lately. I’ve had a few setbacks, tough feedback, and a few unexpected time sinks. I only have three more workdays left here, and it’s going to be a challenge to wrap everything up in time. The long hours and overtime haven’t done much for my mood — but leaving loose ends before my holiday would probably feel worse.

## Things to Look Forward To

Next week I’ll be heading to Tokyo! I’ve got a packed schedule ahead:  

- <Day 43>: Tokyo museums and Akihabara  
- <Day 44>: Meiji Shrine, Harajuku (shopping), and Shibuya  
- <Day 45>: Mori Art Museum, National Art Center, and Nezu Museum  
- <Day 46>: Tokyo Tower, teamLab Borderless, and a foodmarket

It’s going to be an exciting change of scenery — a new city, new museums and a new language.
