My final week in Seoul was bittersweet. I spent time reflecting on my stay here and preparing for the trips to come. Let me tell you how it went.

## The Hills

These were my favorite parts of the past week.

### Closing my laptop with a good feeling

<Fri> was my last day of work before starting the next leg of this journey. I managed to incorporate the final pieces of feedback, wrote communication for my colleagues, and finished off my last tasks. I might not have been able to do everything we had planned beforehand, but considering the circumstances, I’m satisfied with how I left things. I can now start my vacation without a nagging feeling of loose ends.

### Doing a Photoshoot

I spent <Sat> doing a photoshoot. I wanted to capture my trip in a triptych, showing my appreciation of Korean culture, my time spent working, and my wanderlust here. It took some time to get comfortable, but we eventually found a groove I was happy with. I’m still waiting on the edited pictures, but I’m sure they’ll turn out great. I’m just happy I at least have some photos of myself here.

### No Feelings of Regret

I spent my <Tue> evening — my final night in Seoul — thinking about my time here. I thought of some things I missed out on or things I maybe would have done differently, but every time I thought of something, I had a reason why it didn’t happen (tickets were sold out, schedules didn’t align, it just didn’t work out).

If I had really wanted to do those things, my trip would have looked quite a bit different. And honestly, I don’t think I would have wanted to change any of it.

### Time in Taiwan

I arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday, and it has been a blast so far. The Fine Arts Museum was stellar, I’ve had some great snacks, and the Lotus Pond was a sight to behold! I must say that the language barrier is pretty steep. Most people speak English, but when they don’t, things can get tricky. Most signs are in Mandarin, and a lot of the food is foreign to me, so it can be a gamble.

I’m mostly happy to be adventuring again — there’s so much stuff I’ve never seen before!

## The Valleys

This week there were some things I didn’t enjoy too.

### Stuck inside

I spent my final few days stuck inside my hotel — catching up on tasks, doing final preparations for my upcoming vacation, and packing my bags. Seeing anything other than the walls of my room might have been a bit more engaging.

But if I’ve learned anything this trip, it’s that I need time to decompress and plan. If I don’t, my sleep schedule suffers, and as a result I suffer. I see it as an investment in the days to come.

## What to look forward to?

These are the things coming up that I’m most excited for:

- <Day 58>: TWICE Concert in Kaohsiung — I might not have a ticket, but I’ll try to find a bar to celebrate with other unfortunate fans  
- <Day 60>: Early sunset viewing in Alishan Park  
- <Day 61> and <Day 62>: Visiting Taipei City  
- <Day 63>: Flying to Hong Kong
