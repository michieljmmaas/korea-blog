## Settling In
The past week has been quite hectic. I spent a lot of time traveling, adjusting to new time zones, and navigating the first waves of culture shock. Slowly but surely, I’m starting to Feel my Rhythm in this city that feels both new and strangely familiar.  

All that movement made the days fly by. To capture the week, I’ll walk you through some of the Peaks and Valleys I’ve experienced so far.  

I’m still experimenting with the format for these posts, but I’m sure it’ll settle into something natural.  

## The Peaks
A lot has happened over the past week — here are some of my favorite highlights.  

### TWICE Concert in Macau
On <Sat> I saw TWICE live in Macau! It took a fair bit of travel and sweat to get there, but the concert itself was worth it. I even wrote a full blogpost about the whole experience — you can read it here ([--> link](http://localhost:3000/blogs/twice-in-macau)).

### Scoring Tickets for the TWICE Fanmeeting
Somehow, against all odds, I managed to snag tickets for the TWICE Fanmeeting on October 18th. I did this on my tablet, using Lotteria’s wifi, battling ticket scalpers and thousands of other fans for a venue that’s way too small for their level of fame. A lot of people were upset online about missing out, which made me even more grateful (and hyped!) to have a seat.

### My First Kimbap Back
I’ve been devouring kimbap since I arrived. There are so many different fillings, and they’re all delicious. I’m even working on a tier list, which I’ll share later.

### Working Out
It’s a relief to be able to keep exercising here. I’m so used to my gym and running trails back home, but I’m finding ways to adapt. There are still a few details to figure out — like timing, or the hotel gym’s limited equipment — but I’m confident it’ll all come together.

### MMCA
On <Thu> I visited the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA). I joined a guided tour and heard some fascinating stories about the works on display — definitely a highlight of the week.

## The Valleys
Of course, not everything was smooth sailing. Here are the things I struggled with.  

### Missing Out on the TWICE Concert on Sunday
I had hoped to catch TWICE again on <Sun>, but the universe had other plans. I spent most of the day trying (and failing) to secure tickets. In the end I wandered over to Taipa Village for snacks, which was fine — but definitely not what I had planned.  

### Culture Shock in Macau
Macau just didn’t click with me. The crowds, the constant shoving, the lack of personal space, and the confusing pedestrian infrastructure all left me disoriented. Communication was difficult, too.  

Maybe it was jetlag, exhaustion from travel, or the heat (or all three), but I never quite felt at home there. The difference was immediate when I got back to Korea — my mood lifted right away.  

### Rusty Korean
I neglected my Korean studies over the past few months, and it shows. Sometimes I catch myself switching to English, even when I know I could manage in Korean. The words are coming back to me slowly, but it’s still a work in progress.  

### Revisiting Tourist Spots Is Kinda Boring
Last time I was here, I hit most of the big tourist sights. I thought it might be fun to revisit them — but honestly, it wasn’t. It felt like going through the motions of being a tourist, without much joy. New experiences are far more rewarding, so I’ll focus on those moving forward.  

### Finding Time and Energy for Writing
I love the kind messages I’ve received from people reading this blog — thank you! Writing these posts and slipping in little references. I might be here solo (*wink*), but sharing these stories makes it feel less lonely.   

What I didn’t anticipate is just how much energy it takes. After a full day of exploring, working out, and moving around, I often come back to the hotel too tired to write. I’m hoping that as the weeks go on and my schedule settles down, I’ll find more consistent energy for it — maybe in the evenings, or even early mornings.  

## What’s Next?
Here’s what I’m looking forward to next week:  

- <Day 9>: Visiting Suwon to see its impressive fortress  
- <Day 10>: A hike, followed by a traditional sauna  
- <Day 11>: 추석 (Chuseok / Korean Thanksgiving), and hopefully meeting some neighbors  
- <Day 12>: My first day back at work
