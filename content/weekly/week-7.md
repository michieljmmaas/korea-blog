I spent the majority of the week in Tokyo visiting shrines, eating sushi, and not sleeping a whole lot. Let’s dive into it.

## The Hills
I had a lot of fun in Tokyo, so let me tell you what I enjoyed most!

### Sushi
The food in Japan is excellent — from convenience-store snacks to street-side bites to full restaurant dishes. But the meal I loved the most was the sushi at Tenkazushi on <Sat>, my dad’s favorite spot in Shibuya. The fish was incredibly fresh and the service was top-notch. I also discovered a new love for Anago sushi — so much so that they just kept serving it to me without even asking.

### NITTEN
I had unbelievable luck walking into the National Art Center Tokyo on <Sun> while they were hosting NITTEN — a massive open-call art exhibition featuring over 3,000 artworks. There were several categories, like Western-style painting, sculpture, and calligraphy. I started off examining every piece carefully, but after realizing the sheer scale of the show, I picked up the pace.

I really enjoyed the grandeur, the variety, and the quality of the work. I was a bit sad I didn’t have the energy to see the entire exhibition, but everything I did see was fantastic.

### Hokusai Museum
I was disappointed that the National Museum didn’t have any of the famous ukiyo-e woodblock prints on display, so on <Sat> I visited a museum dedicated entirely to Hokusai. Even though they only had a replica of *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*, it was still incredible to see. I spent an unreasonable amount of time studying it up close, taking in every detail. I also learned more about the art form and the artist, which made me appreciate the work even more.

### Bonsai
I adore the art of bonsai — the serenity they give off and the years of care they require. On <Fri> I visited a small greenery that had several on display. I strolled through the aisles admiring the miniature trees like they were tiny works of art.

### Breaking Through the Mountian of Work
After coming back from Tokyo, I felt a bit overwhelmed. There’s still so much I want to do here, and not enough time left. But after two productive days of work on <Thu>, I finally felt the mountain shift — like there was some light at the end of the tunnel. That lifted a huge weight off my shoulders and gave me some of the energy I desperately needed.

## The Valleys
But traveling isn’t all sunshine and sushi. There were a few things I didn’t enjoy quite as much.

### Capsule Hotel
I had the brilliant idea to stay in a capsule hotel during my Tokyo trip. I thought it would be a cool experience (and a good way to save money), but it turned into a nightmare. The lack of personal space, noise pollution, and general inconvenience made it nearly impossible to sleep. I eventually booked a proper hotel for the last two nights to save my sanity — something I probably should’ve done from the start.

### Overtourism
One thing that really bothered me was the number of tourists — especially the inconsiderate ones. Tokyo is already the most populous metropolitan area in the world (over 14 million people). Add an average of 1.5 million tourists on top of that, and you can really feel the strain. Long lines everywhere, luggage taking up space, and the cracks in Japan’s strict social norms all added up. It was sad to see the city suffer from its own success — even though I fully understand why people want to visit.

## What to Look Forward to Next
Next week has some fun things lined up:

- <Day 50>: My last day of work-related focus  
- <Day 51>: A photoshoot to remember my time here  
- <Day 54>: My final full day in Seoul  
- <Day 55>: Flying to Taiwan (Kaohsiung)  

I’m very happy with the time I’ve spent in Seoul, but I also feel like it’s time to move on. I’ve got a few more days to soak up the atmosphere and prepare for the “dessert” this adventure.
