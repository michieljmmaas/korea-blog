I've never been to New York, but I think Hong Kong is the closest thing to it. The huge number of skyscrapers, the distinct neighbourhoods, the crowds of people everywhere. I enjoyed my time here immensely — but of course not everything was perfect.

## Hills
I’m talking about the best things from the past week.

### MAMA
The main reason I went to Hong Kong was to attend MAMA. It was a two-day festival, with a show on <Fri> and another on <Sat>. The shows were spectacular, and it was cool catching a glimpse behind the scenes. I wasn’t familiar with all the acts performing, but the crazed fan girls around me pulled me right into it.

### M+
On <Sun> I went to M+. One of the better modern art museums I visited on this trip. The art was great and really engaging. I think they were renovating a wing, which is too bad because I would’ve loved to see that one too. To think I almost skipped this place is a shame.

### Cantonese Opera
After visiting M+ on <Sun> I had a Cantonese Opera Experience. It was really interesting learning about this art form. They made it super accessible, and it was great getting a small glimpse into the culture.

### The City Scape
Another thing I loved was the cityscape. The giant skyscrapers made you feel so small, and the neon signs gave off so much atmosphere. I can see where Ridley Scott got the inspiration for *Blade Runner*. This was captured best on <Mon> when I visited Victoria Peak and got some great views.

### Location Was Great
The hotel amenities weren’t what I hoped they would be, but the location totally made up for it. Very central, and close to some big highlights. It made getting around the city so easy.

## Happy to Go Back
On <Thu> I flew back home, and honestly, I was happy to. I thought I’d be dreading the trip back, begging for just one more day. But by that point I had been away from my own bed for too long, and was longing for the taste of brown bread.

## Valleys
But that last week of vacation wasn’t all sunshine. Here are the things I disliked.

### Low on Energy
I was low on energy most days. I had to head back to my hotel multiple times to take naps, and there were moments where I could appreciate an exhibit, but I felt too tired to fully enjoy it.

They call New York “The City That Never Sleeps.” Well, I call Hong Kong “The City That I Can’t Seem to Sleep In”!

### So Much Noise
There is so much noise everywhere. Running cars, talking people, store chatter. Even in museums there were loads of kids running around making a ruckus.

## What to Look Forward To:
There won’t be daily updates anymore, but I’ll continue working on the blog. I expected most of these updates to be done before the new year — but check back later if you want to see new features.

Here are the improvements you can expect:

- [x] ~~Updating all the daily and weekly blogs with full text and pictures~~  
- [ ] Adding some more blogposts (Best / Worst Things, My Favorite Blog References / Jokes, Alisan, MAMA, ARARIO)  
- [ ] I’ll add some cool new features — like sorting, ordering and search  
- [ ] I’ll upload all edited photos from the photoshoot.
