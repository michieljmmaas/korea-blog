Brain dump - rest to come later

I’ve never been to New York, but I think this is the closest too it. 

## Hills

Best things.

### MAMA

It wasn’wasn't the best but I still had fun. Not too familiar with the boy groups, but I still liked their performances. The screaming fan girls helped me get hyped too. 

### M+

Some great modern art. Really interesting. I think they were rennovating a wing, which is too bad that I missed that one. 

### Cantonese Opera

Interesting experiene,  was cool to see. 

### The CIty Scape

The city scape was so interesting with all the big skyscrapers and neon lights. I can see where inspiration by Ridley Scott for blade runner. 

### Location was great

The hotel was in a great spot. Close to the happing and public transit stops. 

## Happy to go back

I am happy to go back. I miss brown bread, cheese and my own bed.

## Valleys

### Low on energy

I was pretty low on energy soem days. I had room for it on some days, but Taiwan was more fun for me. Maybe it was the busy week in Taiwan, late nights,  but I felt prety tired often. 

All the caffiene didn’didn't help either I rhink. 

(The City that never sleeps)

### So Much Noise

There is so much noise every where. Running cards, talking people, store chatter. Even in museums there were load of kids running arond making ar uckace, 

It is hard to find a place where it was quiet. 

## What to look forward to:

- I’ll update all the daily posts
- I'll write some more blogs
- I’Il add some cool new features
- I’Il upload all edited photo’ from the photoshoot.
