## Finding My Groove
This past week I’ve really been finding my groove here in Seoul. I’m getting stuff done at the office, getting more familiar with the city’s layout, and actually putting my Korean into practice. Even though I’m only three weeks into this ten-week trip, time feels like it’s flying by. There’s still so much I want to do while I’m here, and the clock is ticking.  

## The Peaks
Let’s go over some of my favorite things from this past week.  

### Hiking Bukhansan 
On <Sun> I went hiking on Bukhansan. It was a real workout, but the scenery and views (except for at the summit) were totally worth it.  

At the summit, things got surprisingly emotional for me. Reaching the top of that mountain felt like an allegory for overcoming my personal struggles in my twenties. I took a moment to reflect on everything I’ve accomplished over the past ten years. It was a euphoric moment that I think I’ll cherish for a long time.

### Arario Museum
On <Fri> I visited the **ARARIO Museum – In Space**, which is in Seoul. It had an impressive collection of contemporary art, and the building itself had a really unique atmosphere. I took a ton of pictures, and I’d love to dedicate a separate post just to that visit once I find the time.

### Going Out to Eat More
Instead of eating convenience store food every night, I’ve been going out to eat more. The food is way better—and incredibly cheap! I usually look for places where other people are also eating alone, which gives me the confidence to do the same.

### Putting My Korean Into Practice
I feel like my Korean has never been better. I’ve been able to use it in all sorts of situations (like my haircut on <Wed>), and it’s been so helpful. I’m reading faster, and I catch myself blurting out Korean phrases without even thinking about how to translate them first.  

It’s really satisfying to see all that study time paying off.

### Meeting New People
Travelling solo can make it hard to meet new people, but this week I had some fun interactions with kind strangers. On <Sat> I went on a date with a Korean girl at a **포장마차** (pojangmacha — Korean street food tent), which was such a cool experience. Then again on <Wed> I went for K-BBQ with a friend I met at the Digital Nomads Drinks event.  

I enjoy solitude, but it can’t beat having a fun evening with good company.

## The Valleys
Of course, there were some challenges this week too.  

### Long Hours at Work
I naturally wake up early and start working soon after. But because of the time difference with the Netherlands, I usually stay online a bit later (till around 19:00). That makes for long days, and without colleagues to remind me to take a lunch break or chat by my desk, I tend to hyperfocus and lose track of time. I usually take a break to work out, but (by definition) that’s not exactly relaxing either.

### All Work and No Play Makes Mike a Dull Boy
These long, uninterrupted workdays can be pretty draining. In the evenings, I try to relax in my hotel room by playing video games or watching YouTube—but then I end up feeling guilty for not doing something more exciting. I learned that these are part of the journey here, but I still find it hard to be satisfied after a day such as that.

### Trying to Do Everything Is Hard
There’s still so much I want to do while I’m here, but finding time between work, sleep, and working out is tougher than I expected. I didn’t update this blog for a few days because I was either too busy exploring the city—or too drained after a long day at the office.  

There’s a lot left on my list, but balancing energy and ambition has turned out to be quite the challenge.

## What’s Next?
Next week I’m going to experiment a bit with my working hours and daily rhythm to see what works best for me.  

There are also some fun things coming up!  
- <Day 22>: Language exchange meetup  
- <Day 23>: TWICE Fanmeeting (mini-concert)  
- <Day 25>: Visiting the Dutch embassy to vote in the elections  
- <Day 26> or <Day 27>: Dinner with Katherine
