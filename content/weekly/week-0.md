## So Much to Do!

In the weeks leading up to my departure, I had a long list of things I needed—or maybe more accurately, wanted—to get done before leaving.

- Fix all the paperwork (flights, hotels, permits, etc.)
- Prepare the work tasks I’d need while in South Korea
- Pack my bags and make sure I had everything I needed
- Buy new underwear, socks, a neck pillow, good walking shoes, and more
- Clean my room, wash clothes, tidy the house
- Paint the window frames

The Wednesday before my flight, I sat down to plan everything out carefully, making sure I had enough time to get it all done.

I also made time to see my friends and family to say goodbye. Ten weeks feels like a long time right now, but I’m sure it will fly by once I’ve landed.

## The Weekend

Friday at work, I got a bit carried away. I was too eager to refactor some code I’d been working on, which meant I left an hour later than planned. By the time I got home, I was too exhausted to do what I had scheduled for that evening.

Not the best start—already falling behind my own plan.

Saturday wasn’t much better. I went to the shopping district near my house to buy the last few items I needed, but it was pouring rain and I couldn’t find most of them.

When I got home, though, I saw that TWICE (my favorite K-pop group) had announced their 10th anniversary schedule. They’re really going all out: a new album, a fan meeting, a pop-up store, a sitcom, and even a movie! How convenient that it all happens while I’ll be there.

That evening, I spent three hours assembling a wooden model of Gwanghwamun (광화문)—a souvenir I had bought three years earlier (to the day!) on my last trip. I couldn’t bring myself to step on the plane while that model was still sitting unopened in its original packaging.
