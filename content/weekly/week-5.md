## Reflection

I was fighting my alarm today again, and had the worst time waking up. I had weird feeling for the last couple of days, and I notice that is is gnawing at my attention span. I feel like my trip is comming to an end too soon. There are many things I (feel like I) still want to do, and trying to fit it all in my remaining days makes them feel more like a energy drain, instead of an energy source. The small novelties here that gave me joy, now full more mundane. Also, and I would have never expected this, but I am getting pretty tired for all the convience store gimbaps. 

But at the same time I am only half way done. There are still three weeks left in here Seoul (2 if subtract my Japan trip), and after that there is still Taiwan an Hong Kong, which I am looking forward to a lot.
