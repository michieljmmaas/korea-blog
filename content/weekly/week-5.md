## At the Halfway Point
As I’m writing this, I’ve officially reached the halfway point of my trip—five weeks done, five to go. With the last two spent traveling, The end feels both far away and close at the same time.  

## The Peaks
Let’s look at all the fun stuff I’ve done over the past week.  

### ASL Season 20 – Finals
One of my favorite things from this week was definitely attending the *StarCraft: Brood War* finals on <Sun>. Seeing an e-sports match has been on my bucket list for so long, and finally getting to watch one live—after initially missing out on tickets—was an amazing experience.  

From the spectacular level of play, to the crowd reactions, to the friendly people I met while waiting in line—it was a blast.  

You should read the blog post I wrote about it! [Link here!](../blogs/starcraft-broodwar)

### Two Theme Parks!
Last week, I visited two theme parks. On <Sun>, I went to Lotte World with Katherine. We had fun walking around the park, soaking in the atmosphere and chatting while waiting in line, but we didn’t get to ride many attractions because the queues were long, and we didn’t have much time there.

Then on <Mon>, I joined a ragtag group of people going to Everland. I spent the whole day going on rides and making friends with the others in the group. The stroopwafels I brought from home to make friends for occasions like this worked perfectly!

### Trot Music Festival
Another highlight was the random Trot Music Festival I stumbled upon on <Sat>. There was a singing competition for locals, with participants of all different skill levels. I had a blast people-watching and clapping along to the performances.  

I wrote a blog post about all the characters I saw there—you should read it! [Link here!](../blogs/trot-festival)

### Combining Work and Pleasure
This past week, I split my days between working for a few hours and then heading out to do touristy stuff. It worked really well because I could still get my required hours in *and* explore the city. It also helped with my usual problem of overloading myself—either by working too long or sightseeing too much.  

It requires some extra planning and juggling, but the result is worth it!

### Making Friends
The part I was most nervous about before this trip was the social aspect. I like solitude, but I know I can get some serious cabin fever if I’m not careful. Luckily, everyone I’ve met so far has been incredibly kind. It helps that the events I’ve gone to are geared toward people looking to make friends, but even outside of those, I’ve noticed my social skills improving a lot. They’ve led me to some great opportunities and memories.  

Meeting Katherine has been a blessing too! Since we’re staying in the same building, it’s easy to meet up, and I feel like we have a lot to talk about because we have such different perspectives on (solo) travel.

## Valleys
But the last week wasn’t all easy. Here’s what I didn’t enjoy.  

### Staying Up Late
My sleep schedule has been pretty bad lately. I’ve had lots of fun events to attend, but not much time to rest—especially at night. I’ve been feeling crankier and less focused at work. I usually use the weekend to relax and catch up on sleep, but this coming one is packed with Halloween events, and the weekend after that I’ll be in Tokyo. We’ll see how that goes.  

<Img fireworks desc="Watching the fireworks was nice, but the two-hour commute back meant I didn’t get to bed until midnight.">

### Losing That Edge
I’ve had this strange feeling lately, like I’m slowly running out of things to be surprised by. The little details that used to make Seoul feel magical—tthe culture, the convience stores even just hearing the language around me—now feel more normal. There’s still a lot I want to do while I am here, but the excitement isn’t as sharp anymore. It’s not bad, just different. I guess I’ve started to settle into the rhythm here, and that early rush of discovery is wearing off.

I think the lack of sleep plays a big part in in too—like it usually does when I’m feeling off.  

<Img desk desc="Also—and I never thought I’d say this—but I’m getting pretty tired of convenience store gimbaps.">

But maybe that’s not a bad thing. If I left still craving more, I’d probably feel unsatisfied—like I didn’t quite get what I came for. Feeling like I’ve seen and done enough means I actually *have*. The wanderlust fading away might just be a sign that it’s time to move on—and that I’m leaving this city exactly when I should.
