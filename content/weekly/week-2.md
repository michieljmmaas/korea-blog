## Back to Work
This week started off with some more touristy things — visiting Suwon on <Sat> and a few museums on <Sun>. But starting from <Tue>, it was back to the office. I’m finding my familiar rhythm again, which is really helping me settle in here.  

## The Peaks
Let’s go over the highs (and lows) of the past week.  

### Working Remotely Is Going Great
I found it surprisingly easy to get back into work mode. The amenities here are excellent — plenty of space, minimal distractions, and great Wi-Fi. The time difference takes some getting used to, but it’s also quite nice to be able to focus on programming without too many meetings in between.

### Suwon
On <Sat>, I went to Suwon — a city known for the remnants of its old fortress. I didn’t visit last time, so it was all new to me. I had a great time exploring different parts of the city and visited the *Nam June Paik Art Center*, which was excellent. That day, I truly felt like a tourist again.

### The Art Museums Here Are Amazing
On <Sun>, I visited the Leeum Museum of Art, which had some incredible pieces. In the first gallery alone they had a Rodin, a Rothko, and a beautiful Clyfford painting. Combined with the *Nam June Paik Art Center* from <Sat>, I’ve already seen some fantastic art. I still have a few more museums on my list to visit while I’m in Seoul — and if these two are any indication, I’m in for a treat.

### Feel My Rhythm
Now that I’ve started working here, I’m finding it easier to keep a healthy routine. My sleep schedule is back to normal, and I feel less tired in the evenings. Work can be draining too, but not nearly as much as exploring all day. I’m also finding more time in the evenings for small chores like grocery shopping or planning, without feeling like I’m wasting time. My weekends now feel like real opportunities to explore.

### Meeting New People
On <Thu>, I went to an event for digital nomads, hoping to meet some friendly people — and I did! I met a few that I’m hoping to stay in touch with while I’m here. It felt great to talk to people face-to-face instead of through a screen, and I also got some great tips on how to meet more people later on.

## The Valleys
But of course, not everything this week was sunshine and smooth sailing.  

### 추석 (Chuseok)
I had hoped my hotel would organize a Chuseok event so guests could meet each other, but there wasn’t one. I thought it would be fun to play some traditional games and try some festive food, but no luck.

### Convenience Store Dinners
I’ve gone to a few restaurants by myself, but it’s just not as fun as going with friends. I usually just eat quickly and leave. The food is great, but the experience feels a bit lonely. So I’ve been defaulting to convenience store dinners — not the most nutritious or exciting option. I really need to get over that hesitation, or better yet, find some dining buddies.

### Skipping My Hike Because of Rain
I had planned to go on a hike on <Sat>, but the weather had other ideas. I’ve done enough hiking to know I’d rather skip it than do it in the rain. Luckily, I’m here for two months, so I can easily reschedule. I still made a good day of it by visiting the Leeum Museum of Art instead!

## What’s Next?
Here’s what I’m looking forward to next week:  
- <Day 15>: Visiting the ARARIO Museum  
- <Day 16>: A date  
- <Day 17>: A hike, followed by a traditional sauna (attempt two)  
- <Day 19>: Dinner with my new friends?
