## Planning and Recharging
All week I’d been keeping a list of errands I needed to take care of here in Seoul — things like booking a haircut, checking in with friends back home, and figuring out how I’ll vote in the Dutch elections. This morning I finally sat down to run through the list, but it ended up taking way longer than I expected.  

I also wanted to get ahead on writing — the blogpost about my hotel and my first weekly recap. Since I’ll be busy this weekend, I started both today. That too took more time than I’d planned. By the time I looked at the clock, it was already 15:00. Too late for any real city exploration, which I had originally hoped to do in the afternoon.  

## Groceries
After another workout session, I went to pick up some groceries. The supermarket feels much closer now than it did on my first trip, and I already know which aisles to head for. Alongside food for dinner, I grabbed two much-needed additions for my room: a laundry basket and a couple of plants.  

On the way back I wandered through the maze of restaurants behind the hotel. I spotted a few good places I might want to try later — and, of course, even more convenience stores.  

Back at the hotel I cooked ramen in the communal kitchen. The tools are solid and everything is labeled clearly. While I was cooking, another guest came in to microwave her dinner. I asked if she knew how to turn on the ventilation, but she didn’t. I’m starting to think most people here don’t really use the kitchen for actual cooking.  

## Ending the Day
I also signed up for a digital nomad community in Seoul that organizes events. They’re hosting a dinner and drinks next Thursday, which sounds like a good chance to meet new people.  

Even though the day wasn’t very eventful, it felt good to finally clear the errands that had been gnawing at me all week. With those out of the way, I’ll be able to focus more on the moment in the coming days.  

## What’s Coming Up Next?
- **Saturday:** a day trip to Suwon, with its impressive fortress and a museum dedicated to an artist I really like  
- **Sunday:** a hike in Bukhansan
