## Back to Work
Today was my first day working as a digital nomad, and it actually felt pretty good to get back into the rhythm. Since I spent yesterday catching up on emails and messages, I was able to jump straight into coding.  

Instead of working from my room, like I’ve done the past few days, I went up to the lounge on the top floor. There’s plenty of space there, and before long, a few other people had joined in to work too.  

I spent the day tackling some tickets, writing up useful notes to share with my colleagues, and setting up a few merge requests. Everything felt surprisingly normal — except for the **seven-hour time difference**. I started around 9:00 (2:00 in the Netherlands) and took a workout break around 15:00 (8:00 in the Netherlands).  

Not having anyone online to message for quick clarifications felt a bit odd, but at the same time, there’s also no one around to interrupt me — so I’ll take that as a win.  

Around 17:00 (10:00 in the Netherlands), I hopped back online for a meeting. Catching up with my colleagues was fun — and it made my day when they told me they’ve been following the blog!  

## Winding Down
When it was lunchtime in the Netherlands (around 19:00 here in Korea), I logged off and raided a few nearby convenience stores. I slipped on my Crocs and white socks (as is customary here) and stocked up on kimbap, protein bars, and ramyeon for the next few days.  

Back at the hotel, I cooked up some ramyeon in the communal kitchen — I’m definitely getting more confident using it now.  

All in all, a pretty good day. I can see myself keeping up this routine for the next six weeks!
