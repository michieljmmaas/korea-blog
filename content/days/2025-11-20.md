Here are some of my thoughts, full blogpost will come later.



## Why am I in Kaoshing?

I had some trouble with the pronounciation, but I felt more comfortable when I saw it transcribed in Hangul (카오슝). 

I was planning to go to the TWICE Concert here this weekend. I had already booked my plane tickets, and hotel, and then I missed out on the tickets for the concert itself. Everything on my side was non refundable, so I was kinda stuck. I eventually decided to see TWICE in Macau on <Day 2>. 

But this city is going crazy with TWICE stuff. One of the members, Tzuyu, is origianlly from Taiwan. This is the first time the group performs in Taiwan, so they are going all out. The sound over 100k tickets for both shows. It sold out in less than 4 minutes. Eve


Everything is blue here. With blue being the color for the tour, and also Tzuyu's representative color. 
- There are adds, paid for fans, welcoming the group everywhere
- Buildings light up blue every night. 
- Bars doing free blue drinks, named after TWICE songs, when you show your tickets
- Traffic lights are blue
- Adds and merch in convience stores
- A metro announcement voice by the group
- Street venders saying they'll be closed this weekend, because they are going to the concert
- THE MAYOR DYED HIS HAIR BLUE!

# brain dump
I went to the Kaoshiung history museum, that was pretty cool

I went to catch a bus. I waved at the busdriver to stop, but I think he thought "No thank you", and he drove off. And, unlike in Seoul, the busses only drive 2 per hours here. So I had to find another way to get there. Different communication style I guess.

Apperently there was a big coup that happend in that actualy building, where they had an exhibition about it. 

- I had some great lunch, I had to wait but is was totally worth it
- The big music building was bit borning
- The Pier2 was fun. Gentrified old port warehouses. Some street art in between.
- Had way too many dumplings for lunch
- The Fine Arts Musuem was great!
- Recognized some artist from earlier this trip and I felt really snobby about it
- I went to the Lotus Pond. I walked the area. Lots of pagada's pavalillion and temples. All light up very nicely. Some of stuff was closed, like the Confusius temple, but I think it was better at night with the lights
- I went another street market for more food.
- The Stinky Tofu was really stinky. I didn't eat it though
- Had some othe rgreat things
- I think I am starting to like bubble tea now.
