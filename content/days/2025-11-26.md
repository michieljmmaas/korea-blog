## Sloppy Eggs

I woke up early and started the day with Lily’s anniversary livestream — an unexpectedly delightful way to ease into the morning. Afterward, I worked on the blog a bit, got ready, and headed down for breakfast. They had eggs! It’s been ages since I’ve had the familiar comfort of soft, slightly sloppy hotel scrambled eggs.

I was up and ready before my first museum openend, so strolled the neighbourhood. With some time to spare, I made my way to **MOCA Taipei**, a museum reviewers described as small and easy to finish in an hour. I spent over two hours there — and loved every minute.

The space *was* small, but the exhibitions were remarkably interactive.

One exhibit let you draw a bird and send it to someone else. I painted a nice little bird and hung it among some… less aesthetically fortunate ones, which made mine look even better by comparison.

One of my favorite pieces was a sushi train filled with origami sushi. Each plate included a card referencing a social issue. You could choose one, fill in some prompts to “shape” the story, then write a comment. Other visitors could respond or boost it.

It was essentially a *physical social media platform*.

I loved the commentary on how we selectively engage with certain topics, ignore others entirely, and often latch onto whatever happens to be trending. It was clever and unsettling in all the right ways.

Everything was in Chinese, so I translated a bunch of the cards using the internet. It was genuinely fascinating to read local perspectives on issues like the Hong Kong resistance movement, the Russia–Ukraine war, and mental health.

After the museum, I went to get some typical Taiwanese lunch. The restaurant used a paper order form. I proudly translated everything, and handed it hover to the staff, but the server ended up speaking English so that hassle wasn't needed at all. I didn’t know the portion sizes and accidentally ordered way too much food — and honestly, I’m glad I did. It felt amazing to have a proper, filling lunch again.

## Downtown Taipei

After lunch, I wandered through some of Taipei’s older neighborhoods, starting with an old street lined with traditional herbal medicine shops. From there, I made my way down to the harbor before attempting a long walk through a nearby park. I got bored partway through and rented a bike, which was faster but not exactly more efficient — bike lanes were sparse, and I kept losing track of the route. Naturally, the moment I hopped on the bike, the surrounding buildings suddenly became far more interesting.

I stopped by an old temple, and read some more wikipedia articles on Buddhism. I continued on to the Red House — once a Japanese boutique store, now a Taiwanese one — before weaving through a few brick alleyways. I even popped into a free children’s museum, which turned out to be surprisingly engaging. Eventually, hunger crept in, and I spent way too long trying to find something appealing to eat. The busy shopping street had endless options, yet nothing really spoke to me. I walked a long distance to a scallion pancake shop that was supposed to open soon, waited about 15 minutes, and it never opened. Exhausted and irritated, I gave up and settled for some hamburgers.

I had planned to squeeze in a smaller museum afterward, but the whole food-hunting detour threw off the timing, so I headed straight to my final stop of the day.


## Chiang Kai-shek Memorial

The memorial is *enormous* — far larger than I expected. After seeing it on countless souvenirs, I knew I had to visit, but I didn’t anticipate the sheer scale of the place.

<Img 19 desc="I mean, this is just the entrance.">

Chiang Kai-shek, former KMT leader, took control of Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War. Given the grandeur of the memorial, I pulled up Wikipedia, and — unsurprisingly — he was not exactly a benevolent figure.

- The **White Terror**, in which dissidents were suppressed  
- Undemocratic rule — Taiwan only democratized after his death  
- Continued claims over mainland China  
- Strict land reforms  
- Corruption  

It’s surreal wandering through a site this massive dedicated to someone with such a complicated, often troubling legacy. Yes, he had some positive contributions — laying structural foundations that Taiwan later built upon, resisting Japanese occupation — but the negatives heavily overshadow them.

I watched the changing of the guards, which was visually impressive but also somewhat theatrical, especially considering its primary audience is tourists. They don’t even perform it when it rains.

Inside the main hall, there was a small exhibit that did the familiar “he did some good… but also some bad” balancing act. Still, I learned a lot. They even displayed a copy of the UN vote transferring China’s seat to the PRC in 1970, which was super interetsing. 

The memorial closed at 18:00, so I had to leave, but I feel like I could’ve spent more time there. 

While waking out of the memorial I was glued to my phone, asking ChatGPT about the Taiwanese-Chinese tensions, and how the different view look at it. Super interesting stuff, now that I had all that context. Everything felt tangled, nuanced, and full of contradictions.

## Din Tai Fung

For dinner, I finally decided to try Din Tai Fung — practically an institution here. When I arrived, I discovered the location was take-out only. Perfect. I placed a big order of their most recommended items and waited about 25 minutes. It was unbelievably busy for a Wednesday night, with a constant stream of delivery drivers.

Back at the hotel, I unpacked everything. It was good… but honestly? I’ve had better I feel. The food was warm but slightly soggy from condensation. Maybe dining in is the true experience. Still, I’m happy I finally tried it.

I planned to prep more of the trip and start on Hong Kong planning, but I got a major after dinner-dip. Instead I fell down a rabbit hole of videos about the Chinese Civil War and Taiwanese politics — and eventually just went to bed early.

A genuinely great day with some fantastic sights. MOCA Taipei was wonderful, and exploring downtown was unexpectedly engaging. I feel like I covered a lot of the city. It’s a shame I wasted over an hour hunting for food, but everything worked out in the end.

Learning about Taiwanese history and politics was incredibly interesting. I still don’t fully understand it — but honestly, I’m not sure anyone does.
