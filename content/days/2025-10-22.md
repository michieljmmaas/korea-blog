## Get in Line!
For TWICE’s 10th anniversary, they set up a pop-up store — basically a disguised merch booth with some extra props. I wanted to go on Monday (<Day 25 link="twice-pop-up-store">), but the queue was already full. I decided to try again today because I wanted to see the inside for myself and score some cool merch!  

So I got on the metro and headed back to the Yongsan Mall. I arrived an hour before the mall opened — 30 minutes before the digital queue would open (I’d learned my lesson this time). While waiting in line, I took out my tablet and got some work done.

Once the slots opened up, I claimed a spot and was free to wait somewhere else. I decided on one of the three Starbucks inside the mall — it had plenty of space and, most importantly, power outlets for my laptop. I got some breakfast and tea (to justify my stay) and got to work.  

After a while, I noticed the guy sitting across from me was also wearing TWICE merch and checking the live merch stock for the pop-up store on his phone. This guy was doing *exactly* what I was doing: working remotely while juggling TWICE stuff! I subtly rotated my water bottle so the TWICE stickers were visible, angled my laptop with its TWICE decals toward him, even coughed once or twice — but he was too deep in meetings to notice.  

Around lunchtime, I saw my spot moving up in the queue, so I grabbed a quick lunch and headed to the booth.  

## TWICE Pop-up Store
I arrived at the booth and was allowed to enter without waiting. I showed them my TWICE movie ticket, which I luckily still had in my wallet, and received a bingo card for it! To complete the card, you had to do various tasks: take photos with props and upload them to social media, play a few games (ring toss, block stacking, and button mashing), and — of course — buy merch for two of them.

The item I really wanted — a zip-up hoodie — had already sold out. So I opted for a t-shirt and a keychain instead. There were plenty of TWIVELYs, but each one focused on a single member, and since I don’t really have a bias, I skipped those. I walked around, read the messages the members had written on the walls, took some more pictures, and completed the bingo card.

The whole experience was a bit strange. I mean, I really like TWICE (I think I’ve made that pretty clear over the past few days), but this pop-up store wasn’t really my thing. It was such a hassle to even get in, only to buy overpriced merch and get a few bonus photocards and stickers. I’d already seen much of the interior on social media, so there wasn’t much left to be excited about. Still, I’m happy I got the t-shirt!  

<Img haul-2 desc="I only paid for the shirt and the keychain — the rest were freebies!">

Visiting the pop-up store will probably be the last TWICE-related event I do for a while. Their anniversary celebrations are over, and they’ll be heading back on tour soon, so expect to see some more “touristy” posts in the future.  

## Ending the Day Off
After leaving the pop-up store, I went back to my hotel, set up my workspace, and got a few more hours of work in. I had a good call where we managed to close in on some outstanding tasks. Around 19:00, I closed my laptop and went out to dinner with Kathrine, my friend who’s staying at the same hotel.  

We had a great time talking about future plans for Seoul and finding that elusive work-life balance. I really enjoy chatting with her — our lives are so different, yet we share a surprising number of similarities. We ended the night with a stroll along 청계천 (Cheonggyecheon Stream) and called it a day.

Today was a bit hectic — between the unstable work setup and waiting in line for the pop-up store — but I still managed to get everything done and even scored some merch. Another successful day for the books!
