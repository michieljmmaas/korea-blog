## The Room
When I finally got to my hotel, after travelling for 22 hours, I put my bags down, put on my pyjama and went straight to bed. I woke up 2 hours later and couldn't fall back asleep. So I spent the witching hours doing what I have never done before: unpacking my bags and putting my clothes in the closet of my hotel room. Normally I don't spend enough time in a hotel for this to be useful, but since I will be staying here for the next two months, I might as well. The room is pretty nice actually. There is plenty of space to walk around, enough surface area to place my things, and wall outlets to plug in and charge all my devices (South Korea uses the same outlet as the EU, which saves on adapter costs). The bathroom was a bit dirty, with some lost hairs from the previous tenant and a weird stain on the mirror.  

After doing all that, I took a quick nap, because soon after I was off to Macau.  

## On the Road Again
Yesterday I took an express train and the metro to my hotel. This morning I found out there is a bus straight to the airport that leaves 500m from my hotel, so let's try that. Arriving at the bus stall there were two people waiting: an elderly gentleman and a flight attendant (this has to be the correct bus stop!). After I sat down, the elderly gentleman was staring at me. Once I turned to face him, he asked me in Korean: "Where are you from?" Very proudly I pronounced I was from the Netherlands in my best Korean. He then started this whole elaborate sentence I couldn't understand. He kept repeating this word 풍차 (puung-cha) that I didn't know the meaning of. I asked him to explain to me what it meant, but I couldn't make any sense of it. The bus arrived two minutes later and I got on. I took out my phone and put the word in the translation app. He was talking about windmills. That explained the other words he said: "turning" / "going round" and "wind." So much for my first Korean conversation.  

Once I got to the gate for my plane, I noticed I wasn't the only person travelling for the TWICE concert. I saw multiple people wearing TWICE merch and they were playing their songs in the food stall nearby. The other thing I noticed was that I was the only Westerner there. All communication was in Korean, but once it was my turn I saw them change their demeanor and talk English to me. I have a feeling this will happen more and more.  

The flight was fine, I took some more naps, and before I knew it I was in Macau. Once I landed I took out some cash and went to wait at the bus stop to go to my hotel. I almost paid €10 for a €0.60 bus trip before the bus driver told me he didn't have change. I got some food at the 7-11 in the terminal to get some change, and headed back. That’s when I noticed the advertisements in the terminal. Some fans had bought airtime on the advertisement boards to welcome Mina, one of the members of TWICE, to Macau. I saw things like this before in Korea, mostly to celebrate artists' birthdays.  

## What happens in Macau, stays in Macau
For those who don't know, Macau is like the Las Vegas of the East. You can't legally gamble in China, Vietnam, and Japan. South Korea only has two casinos in the whole country. Macau has over 40. They get over 30 million visitors a year, while only having a population of around 600,000. Their gambling industry is seven times that of Las Vegas. Their laws are different because, like Hong Kong, they are a Special Administrative Region, as they used to be a colony of Portugal. This is also why all signage here is in Cantonese and Portuguese, but only 7% of the population actually speak Portuguese. This tiny island is littered with giant hotels and casinos and, next to that, giant high-rises housing all the people working in those hotels and casinos.  

It is also hot as balls here, and very humid. Which is a problem because I only brought one pair of pants with me.  

## The Concert
I dropped off my bags in my hotel and headed to 'The Venetian' for the concert. This is a giant mall-casino-hotel hybrid made to look like Venice, including a faux canal with gondolas. The place was packed with people attending the concert. Fans were dressing up like the artists from specific music videos or wearing the representative colors of their favorite members. I wore my tour shirt from when I saw them in Berlin two years ago.  

I had to wait in line to get my ticket. I bought it second-hand using a reseller app. The seller sent me a packet with the receipt that he had bought the ticket, a photocopy of his passport and credit card, and a piece of paper declaring that I was now the rightful owner of the ticket (with the logo of the original ticket distributor). I was fully prepared to be declined access to the event as this didn't seem like a legit way to get tickets. But once I got to the register and showed the attendant my paperwork, I got my tickets without any further questions.  

I headed to the concert area, bought a new shirt and hoodie ("For you - XL!"), and got to the arena. The area I was standing in was already quite full of fans, but (other than in the Netherlands) I was taller than most people there and had a great view of the stage!  

The concert was a blast, with people singing and dancing along. Most people around me had their phones out the entire concert. I only took a few pictures of them performing. I never watch those videos back anyway, and I see much better with my eyes than through a screen. This way I felt way more into it, and I even managed to make eye contact with some of the members (or at least I think I did).
