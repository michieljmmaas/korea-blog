## The Room
When I finally got to my hotel, after travelling for 22 hours, I put by bags down, put on my pyama and went straight to bed. I woke up 2 hours later, and couldn't fall back asleep. So I spent the witching hours doing what I have never done before, unpacking my bags and putting my clothes in the closet of my hotelroom. Normally don't spend enough time in a hotel for this to be usefull, but since I will be staying here for the next to month, I might as well. The room i pretty nice actually. There is plenty of space to walk around, enough surface area to place my things and walloutlets to plugin to charge all my deviced (South Korea uses the same outlet as the EU, that saves on adapter costs). The bathroom was a bit dirty, with some lost hairs from the previous tennent and a wierd stain on the mirror. 

After doing all that, I took a quick nap, because soon after that I was of to Macau. 

## On the Road Again
Yesterday I took a express train and the metro to my hotel. This morning I found out there there is a bus, straight to the airport, that leaves 500m from my hotel, so let's try that. Arriving at the bus stall there were two people waiting. And elderly gentlemen, and a flight attendend (this has to be the correct bus stop!). After I sat the down the elderly gentle was staring at me. Once I turned to face him, he asked me in Korean "Where are you from?". Very proudly I pronounced I was from the Netherlands in my best Korean. The then start this whole elobrate sentence I couldn't understand. He kept repeating this word 풍차 (puung-cha) that I didn't know the meaning. I asked him to explaing to me what it meant, but I couldn't make any sense of it. The bus arrived two minutes later and I got on. I took out my found and put the word in the translation app. He was talking about windmills. That explained the other words he said "turning" / "going round" and "wind". So much for my first Korean conversation. 

Once I got to the gate for my plane I noticed I wasn't the only person travelling for the TWICE concert. I saw multiple people wearing TWICE merch and they were playing there songs in the foodstall nearby. The other thing I noticed was that I was the only westener there. All communication was in Korean, but once it was my turn I saw them change their demeanor and talk English to me. I have a feeling this will happen more and more. 

The flight was fine, I took some more naps, and before I knew it I was in Macau. Once I landed I took out some cash, and went to wait at the busstop to go to my hotel. I almost paid €10,- for a €0,60 bus trip, before the busdriver told me he didn't have change. I got some food at the 7-11 in the terminal to get some change, and headed back. That I noticed the advertisments in the terminal. Some fans had bought airtime on the advertisment boards to welcom Mina, one of the members of TWICE, to Macao. I saw things like this before in Korea, mostly to celebrate artists's birthdays. 

## What happens in Macau, stays in Macau
For those who don't know, Macua is like the Las Vegas of the East. You can't legally gamble in China, Vietnam and Japan. South Korea only has two casino's in the whole country. Macau has over over 40. They get over 30 million vistors a year, while only having a population of around 600.000. Their gambling industry is 7 times that of Las Vegas. Their laws are different because, like Hong Kong, they are a Special Administrative Region as they used to be a collony from Portugal. This is also why all signage here is in Cantose and Portugese, but only 7% of the population actually speak Portugese. This tiny island is littered with giant hotels and casino's and next tot that giant highrises housing all the people working in those hotels and casino's. 

It is also hot as balls here, and very humid. Which Is a problem because I only brought one pair of pants with me. 

## The Concert
I dropped of my bags in my hotel and headed to 'The Venetian' for the concert. This is giant mall-casino-hotel hybrid made to look like Venice. Including a faux cancal with gondola's. The place was packed with people attending the concert. Fans were dressing up like the artists from specifc music videos or wearing the representivte colors of their favorite members. I wore my tourshirt from when I say them in Berlin two years ago. 

I had to wait in line to get my ticket. I bought it second hand using a reseller app. The seller send me a packet with the reciept that he had bought the ticket, a photo copy his pasport and creditcard, and a piece of paper declaring that I was now the rightful owner of the ticket (with the logo of the origal ticket distributed). I was fully prepared to be declined access to the event as this didn't seem like a legit way to get tickets. But once I got to the register, showed the attendant my paperwork, I got my tickets without any further questions. 

I headed to the concert area, bought a new shirt and hoody ("For you - XL!"), and got to the arena. The area I was stading in was already quite full of fans, but (other than in the Netherlands) I was taller than most people there and had a great view of the stage!

The concert was a blast, with peopling singing and dancing along. Most people around me had their phones out the entire concert, I only took a few picture of them performing. I never watch those videos back anyway, and I see much better with my eyes than through a screen. This way I felt way more in to it, and I even managed to make eye contact with some of the members (or atleast I think I did).
