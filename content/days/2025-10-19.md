## Writing the TWICE Fanmeeting Blogpost
I woke up still giddy from the TWICE fanmeeting yesterday. I hadn’t planned much for today, so I allowed myself to take it slow. My main goal was to write an extensive blog post about the fanmeeting while everything was still fresh in my memory. I had so much fun writing, rewatching the livestream, and thinking of ways to introduce you guys to the world of TWICE. [You can read the blog post here](../blogs/fanmeeting)!  

I followed my newly designed schedule to stop myself from overloading again, which meant taking a real break for lunch. Instead of eating a kimbap at my desk like I usually do, I actually went outside. I entered a ‘Paris Baguette’—a popular bakery chain here—to grab some pastries. The place is almost a caricature of a French boulangerie: all pastries individually wrapped in plastic and displayed so you can load them onto a tray before paying. Most of them are sweet, overpriced, Easternized versions of well-known pastries.

## Working Out
I had grown tired of the gym included with my hotel. The space was too small, I was missing most of my favorite machines, and the reservation system was a pain. One time, I booked a slot for 12:15, but because the lobby staff were on lunch break (all power to them!), I had to wait until 13:15—even though no one was using the gym!  

Luckily, there was another gym in the building’s basement floor, so I decided to check it out. When I exited the elevator, I stepped into a fully equipped gym: plenty of machines, spacious layout, proper padding on the floor, and a great selection of weights. This was exactly what I’d been missing!  

I walked over to the counter—music blasting far too loud—and asked for a monthly membership. Since I’m leaving Seoul on the 19th, that would line up perfectly. The price estimate, however, shocked me: ₩120,000 (~€75). That was much more than expected (for comparison, I only pay about €20 at home). I told the staff member I needed to think about it and stepped into the elevator.  

Just before the doors closed, they opened again. The attendant came running with a better offer: ₩100,000 (~€60). I wasn’t even trying to haggle, but this was tempting. I got out of the elevator, did some quick napkin math on my phone, and agreed. It was still more than I wanted to pay, but having a real gym—with proper equipment, no reservations, and longer hours—felt worth it. After signing the forms and taking a photo, I finally started my best workout in Seoul so far. It felt amazing to follow my usual routine again.

## Just Me, Saving Democracy from Populism
After getting back to my room, I took a quick shower, did a load of laundry, and prepared my ballot. To be sure, I ran through two vote-matching programs and compared the results. I reviewed key policy stances, theoretical coalition possibilities, and the candidate lists.  

I ended up voting for [Daniëlle Hirsch](https://groenlinkspvda.nl/onze-mensen/kandidaten-tk25/danielle-hirsch-2/), the same person I supported two years ago.  

Even though some of the vote matching pointed my to PvdD, I found myself persuaded by GroenLinks–PvdA’s reasoning on several points, while PvdD opinions (like not allowing vacations home to be used as domiciles to not distrub nature) where not to my likeing. With the current polls, I think the only realistic coalition would be GroenLinks–PvdA, VVD, CDA, and D66—since nobody wants to govern with PVV again. Given VVD and CDA’s efforts to distance themselves from GroenLinks–PvdA, I believe it’s crucial that the green social democrats have enough seats to be part of the coalition—and maybe even deliver the prime minister.  

After chosing which party I want to vote for I go to [Stem op een Vrouw](https://stemopeenvrouw.com/) to find a female candidate who could benefit from preferential votes. I reviewed the profiles of women just below the polling threshold, but none really impressed me this time. Daniëlle Hirsch did last time, she used to serve on the board of a climate-change organization and focuses strongly on human rights. Back then, she actively campaigned and eventually secured a seat thanks to preferential votes ([NOS article here](https://nos.nl/artikel/2499948-veel-voorkeurstemmen-op-lagere-kandidaten-groenlinks-pvda)).  

Since then, I’ve been following her work, and she’s genuinely impressive: active in debates, engaged on social media, and consistently pushing for causes I care about. Her [list of parliamentary questions](https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerleden_en_commissies/alle_kamerleden/hirsch-dh-groenlinks-pvda) is long and thoughtful—perfectly aligned with my priorities. She’s 23rd on the list now, which might just be enough for a seat, but there’s always a chance others could surpass her in preferential votes. I really hope she makes it back; she represents the ideals I believe in.  

So if you’re still on the fence about who to vote for—she’s my pick!

## Anniversary’s Eve
I spent the evening finishing my blog and managed to wrap it up just in time for TWICE’s Debut Anniversary Eve livestream. To celebrate their debut, the group had recorded a special video of themselves hanging out and playing games. The stream started at 23:00 and ended just after midnight. I was there live, along with 28,000 other ONCEs, all wishing them a happy anniversary.

It was a slow, easy day, but a good one. I really enjoyed rewatching the livestream, understanding more now that there were subtitles, and chosing my favorite moments from the stream for the blogpost. My new schedule—with its forced breaks—worked surprisingly well too!
