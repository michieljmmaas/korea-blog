## Easy Morning
I woke up, still all giddy from the TWICE Fanmeeting from yesterday. I hadn't planned too much today, so I was allowed to take some more rest. My main goal was writing an extensive blogpost about the TWICE fanmeeting, so I could remember every moment of it. [You can read it here](../blogs/fanmeeting)!  


I did this while trying out my newly designed schedule to stop myself from overloading myself. 

So for lunch I decided to take an actualy break. Instead of eating a Kimbap at my desk, what I usaully do, I went to outside the door. I enterted the 'Paris Baguette' (a popular bakery chain here) to get some pastries. This place is a characture of what you would expect from a french Boulanger. All pastries are wrapped in plastic and put out so you can load them onto your tray before buying them. Most of the pastries are sweet, overpriced eastern-ized variant of know pastries.

## Working out
I had enough of the gym included in my hotel. The space was too small, I was messing all my favourite machines, and the reservation system is a pain. One time put in a request to workout at 12:15. But because the lobby is on a lunch break then (all power to them!) I had to wait till 13:15 to work out because my request couldn't be full filled, eventough no one was in the gym! 

Luckly there is a gym on the first basement floor, that should work better. I took the elevator to the gym level and exited into a fully equipped gym. Loads of diifferent machines, ample space and padding on the floor and a large selection of plates! This is what I have been missing all for the past month! I walked over to the counter, music blasting way too loud, and asked for a monthly membership. I will be leaving Seoul the 19th, Seoul this would line up perfectly. I got a price estimated that was way higher than expected ₩120.000 (~€75.00) .That was way more than I was expecting (for comparisson I only pay like €20,- for my gym at home). Understandle that they want to upsell you to longer contract, but I am only so long in Seoul. I said that I had to think about it. I wanted to go back to my room and do some calculations to see if it was worth it. 

Once I got in back in the elevator, and the doors closed, they opened once again. It was the desk attended, he came back with a better offer: ₩100.000 (~€60.00). I wasn't even trying to haggle, but this offer was tempting. I got out of the elevator, did some napkin math on my phone and aggreed to the price. It is still more than I would have like to have paid, but I felt it was worth it. Not having to register for a workout, longer opening hours and a fully equiped gym, would lead ot better workouts (thus better mood) I reasoned. 

After filling in the forms and taking a picture, I started my best workout in Seoul yet! It was so nice getting to use proper equipment and follow my usualy workout routine.

## Just me, saving Democracy from Populism
When I got back to my room I took a quick shower, did a run of laundry and prepared by ballot. Just to sure I did two votematching programs, and looked for the answers and my matches. I
