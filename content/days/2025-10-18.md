## Getting Ready for the Fanmeeting
I spent the morning planning out the remaining days of my stay in Seoul and came up with a new daily routine to help me avoid overloading certain activities. I also looked into how and for whom I’ll vote in the Dutch elections and updated my finances.  

After that, I took a shower, put on my best TWICE merch, and watched the final episode of *SIXTEEN*—the TV show that formed TWICE. I’d seen clips before but had never watched the whole thing. I started the series before leaving for Korea but saved the finale for today. It was emotional and fascinating to hear producer J.Y. Park explain his choices for the group’s final lineup, showing how much faith he had in their potential.

I saved it for today because I was attending TWICE’s **10th Anniversary Fanmeeting**—a truly special event. For a K-pop group to stay together for ten years is rare, and getting a ticket was pure luck. I still can’t believe I managed to get one!

## Going to the Venue
The venue, **Korea University’s Tiger Dome**, was just a short bus ride from my hotel. At the bus stop, I saw others in TWICE merch and outfits inspired by different eras—the dress code for the event. The dome only seats about 6,000 people, which is tiny for a group that sells out SoFi and Nissan Stadiums (70,000+ capacity) for multiple nights. No wonder so many fans online were heartbroken to miss out!  

When I arrived, the area was already buzzing. Fans were taking photos, filming dance challenges, and chatting with other ONCEs.

I had hoped to buy some event-exclusive merch, so I got there around 13:00—four hours before the show. But instead of a physical line, it turned out to be a **digital queue**. You were only able to join this queue if you are part of the offical fan club (which I am), close enough in geographical location to the actual merch booth (which I was) and in time before all the slots where claimed (which I was not). Also, my favorite items were already sold out. Hopefully, I’ll get another chance later this week at their pop-up store.  

With time to spare, I explored the campus while listening to TWICE’s discography from the past decade. I passed dorms, large academic halls, and even a small Buddhist temple—all while reminiscing about the songs that have accompanied me over the last six years.

To pass more time, I grabbed lunch before the 17:00 show. Knowing fan meetings can last over three hours, I needed the energy. I ordered kimbap and 튀김 (*twigim*—fried snacks). The portions looked small on the menu, so I overordered as usual. While eating, I watched some behind-the-scenes TWICE content, including the making of *ME+YOU*, their latest fan song ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqorlX_5oHQ)).  

Halfway through, the staff brought me an extra dish for free—probably a mistaken order they decided to gift the foreigner. I hadn’t even finished my own food yet, but it was still a kind gesture.

## TWICE FANMEETING [10VE UNIVERSE]
After eating enough to feed an orphanage, I headed back to the venue. Fans in elaborate costumes filled the area, showing off their favorite member’s look. Upon entry, I received photocards, a banner, and a paper airplane template for fans to write messages and toss during a segment.  

My seat was better than expected. As I looked around, the atmosphere built—waves of excitement, laughter, and camera flashes everywhere. When the lights dimmed and everyone raised their lightsticks, the crowd erupted—it was showtime.

I'll write a short summary here, — [but I wrote a full blogpost about the experience here](../blogs/fanmeeting)!

The fanmeeting kicked off with some of their biggest songs, complete with synchronized chants and glowing lightsticks filling the dome. Afterward came costume changes, sentimental videos, and nostalgic stories tied to the event’s theme: **Time Capsule**.  

They shared unseen photos from their group chat and funny anecdotes—like the time they barged into Nayeon’s room at midnight to celebrate her birthday, only to find her gone. They had filmed themselves singing Happy Birthday to her empty bed, placeing the cake there, blowing out the candles and then eating the cake themselves.  

The group also played some games, including “Shouting in Silence” a fan favorite where members wear noise-canceling headphones and try to lip-read each other—it’s pure chaos every time.  

Like I mentioned, this isn’t a concert in the usual sense, but more a heartfelt bonding moment between TWICE and ONCE.

They followed with some rare performances—ballads and old songs they hadn’t sung live in years. 

After a final outfit change, they did a **fan walk**, circling the gymnasium to greet fans up close. I was seated in the third row of the second tier, and they passed right by me!  

<Img close desc="I have never been this close to them before!">

Finally, a highlight video played, chronicling TWICE’s ten-year journey—the highs, lows, and triumphs. Watching it hit me hard; I could map their timeline to my own life as a fan for the past six years. Seeing them succeed after everything they’ve gone through made me deeply emotional.  

As the event closed, TWICE and ONCE exchanged chants of *“사랑해!”* (“We love you!”) and *“행복해!”* ("We are so happy!”). Sana wrapped things up perfectly, saying:  

> “TWICE is already going to be TWICE forever. ONCE, you’re also ONCE forever!”

## I Don’t Ever Want This Feeling to Go Away
As we exited, every fan received a complimentary **Cinnamoroll** in TWICE-themed packaging (they truly care for us). Outside, fans were crying, hugging, and singing together. Some arranged their lightsticks on the ground to form the TWICE logo, while others took photos with costumed attendees who had become mini-celebrities for the night.

Walking back to the metro, I couldn’t stop smiling. I’ve dreamed of coming to Korea for years, and as a long-time ONCE, this was truly the perfect moment to do it. Attending this fanmeeting, surrounded by thousands of people who share that same joy, was something beyond what I ever dared to imagine.  

Following TWICE’s journey has brought me so much happiness, motivation, and comfort—and being able to share this milestone with them in person felt *truly “One in a Million.”*
