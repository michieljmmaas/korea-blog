## Stocking Up
I got a big breakfast and stocked up on lunch, snacks, and water for my big hike. While checking out, the cashier gave me two extra tea bottles — apparently I had missed a promotion. I was hesitant about carrying more weight, but as soon as she said “free,” I was sold.

## Getting There
I took the metro and then the bus to the start of Dragon’s Back. I had my phone out to navigate, but there was a group of boomers in hiking gear I could follow. The bus took me all the way to Shek O, going far away from the center, but even out there the skyscraper problem persisted.

## The Dragon’s Back
The Dragon’s Back was an easy hike that was supposed to take me four hours. I was feeling great and had a good pace, overtaking the boomers within the first kilometer. The views were nice, showing the trail leading back toward the city. The climate was very different here — no large trees, mostly shrubbery — and the wind was strong, which made for great climate control.

I finished the trail in two hours and felt like I had only just started. I took some time to rest, had some food, and drank some of my extra tea. I took out my phone and planned another route. Another trail would peak pretty close to where I was, but my navigation sent me all the way around the area, adding a big detour. I didn’t trust it, so I started walking again.

## The Twins
I should have trusted it, because I ended up walking along a road meant for cars. There was one pretty scary part with a sharp turn where drivers had no visibility, and I was scared I was going to get run over. But I refused to take the 45-minute detour when the trail entrance was right there (somewhere). I eventually hopped a fence, did some off-roading, and managed to reconnect with the trail.

I walked along the paved road, passing many wide water reservoirs, stunning vistas, and a blocked-off hidden waterfall — all while catching up on my podcasts.

I took another break before the big climb up the “Twins,” the two mountains I had glimpsed while hiking Dragon’s Back. That break was a good call, because the climb was intense. It was steep, rising about 250 meters in elevation in less than a kilometer.

While climbing, I started imagining things again. These two mountains symbolized this trip. The first big hill was getting here:

- All the planning  
- The paperwork  
- Convincing my work to let me do this  
- Building this blog  
- Studying Korean for five years  

At this point, sweat was dripping. I finally reached the “top,” but I wasn’t done yet. There was another hill.

This one represented all the struggles I had during the trip:

- Adapting to the culture  
- Finding my groove in Seoul  
- Trying to make friends  
- Missing out on tickets  
- Balancing work and adventure  

When I finally conquered that second hill, I felt amazing. I thought to myself, *“Is there something I can’t do?”* With every step I take, I get closer to my goals — and eventually I reach them. I proved to myself that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to.

From the top, I got some stunning views, rewarding me for all my hard work.

When I descended the hill, I ended up at another bus stop. I considered heading back to the hotel. It was 15:00, I had been hiking for four hours, but I was riding my high — so I made the decision to continue.

## Devil Claw
I made the wrong decision. The rest of the hike wasn’t nearly as eventful. I got stuck in a small park and hiked through a neighborhood where the only notable sights were big villas, expensive cars, and white people.

When I eventually reached the trail, it wasn’t nearly as well maintained as the others, so I spent time crawling under branches and worming my way around bushes. I eventually got up on a big rock and got a decent view, but I had burned through all my endorphins on the previous leg.

I got off the rocks and raced back toward civilization, catching the first bus I saw. When I got back to the hotel, I was exhausted. I took a shower, ate all the snacks in my bag, and took another nap.

## Dinner
When I arose from my slumber, it was time for dinner. I had originally planned to visit a street restaurant with good seafood dishes (I wanted to try the “spicy crab”), but the internet told me they didn’t serve single-person portions — and the street atmosphere felt too hectic for my current state. So I went back to the diner, had a baked rice dish, and called it a day.

I had a nice day of hiking, but I probably should have stopped earlier. The last leg wasn’t that interesting, and I feel like I pushed myself too hard at the end.

Seems like the one thing I *can’t* do is pace myself.
