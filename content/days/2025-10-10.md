## Running in the Rain
It was raining again today, but that wasn’t going to stop me from going for a run. I layered up and headed back to the Cheonggyecheon stream for a workout. I’m getting more familiar with the track now — I can even count the bridges I cross.

Afterward, I went back to the hotel to freshen up. I had the day off work and wanted to explore the city again. Before heading to my first museum, I stopped by a local hairdresser to make an appointment. When she saw me, she looked a bit shocked and immediately wanted to say she didn’t speak English. No matter — I just need a haircut real bad. Let’s see how it turns out next Wednesday (atleast, that is what I hoped I said).  

## Jogyesa
On my way to my first museum, I passed by Jogyesa — a giant Buddhist temple right in the middle of the city. I visited it last time I was here, but this time it was beautifully decorated with flowers. Apparently, there’s a chrysanthemum flower festival held every year, and I just happened to arrive at the right time.  

I took some photos, though not of the main hall or the giant golden Buddha inside — out of respect, since there were many people praying.

## ARARIO Museum – In Space
The first museum I visited was the **ARARIO Museum – In Space**. It’s actually in Seoul, but the name comes from the fact that they took an abandoned office building — *the space* — and filled it with incredible modern art.  

Last time I visited South Korea, I went to their Jeju location, which uses a similar concept but spread over three buildings.  

And honestly, this might just be the best modern art museum I’ve visited so far! The space itself is fascinating — narrow hallways, exposed concrete, weird angles — and the art fits perfectly within it. I took way too many pictures to post here, so I made it into a a separate post: <Blog arario desc="ARARIO Museum in Space">. 

Here are a few highlights:

There were so many great artists and stories, and the run-down office setting added a unique atmosphere to the whole experience.  

Outside, there’s a traditional teahouse where they serve coffee, and next to it stands a sleek modern glass-and-concrete building with four floors — each housing a different (and very expensive) restaurant.

## Daelim Museum – *Petra Collins: fangirls*
My second stop was the **Daelim Museum**, which was hosting a solo exhibition by photographer *Petra Collins*. I expected a general art museum, but they had converted the entire building into her world.  

I’m usually not that into photography, but this exhibition was fantastic. It spanned three floors, showing her growth as an artist.  

The first floor showed her early 35mm photos — she started shooting at just 15 years old.  
The second floor was where things got really interesting, with installations and absurdist elements. I especially loved her series with actress Alexa Demie, where she reimagines fairy-tale characters in real-world settings.

The last floor focused on her more recent work — collaborations on music videos, fashion campaigns, and magazine covers. It was really cool to see her evolve. From find her voice to turning her art into a business.  

## Gwanghwamun Square
By the time I left, it was still pouring, but I was near **Gwanghwamun Square**, so I decided to stop by. The square sits in front of Gyeongbok Palace (which I visited on <Day 7 link="gyeongbokgung-경복궁">) and is one of Seoul’s most historically significant places.  

It’s home to several government ministries, the site of major protests (like the Dutch *Malieveld*), and two grand statues:  
- **King Sejong the Great**, who created the Korean alphabet *Hangul* (he’s also on the ₩10,000 bill, about €5).  
- **Admiral Yi Sun-sin**, a legendary naval commander who invented the turtle ship (Their unique unit *Civilization V*).  

It was raining cats and dogs, so I didn’t linger too long, but it was still worth the visit.

My next stop was a record shop to pick up the new TWICE album. It was located inside a massive bookstore — 9,000m² with over 25km of walkways! I didn’t take pictures since it was packed (everyone hiding from the rain). Unfortunately, the store told me the delivery truck was delayed, so the album hadn’t arrived yet. Too bad, I’ll try again tomorrow.  

I browsed the shelves for a bit, but my Korean isn’t good enough yet to justify buying a book. Eventually, I went looking for food and found a small diner where people were eating alone — which gave me the courage to do the same. The place was hectic, but the food was incredible. I ordered a fresh kimbap, and it might have been the best I’ve had so far (who would’ve guessed?).

Today was a long day, and the rain didn’t help, but it was still a lot of fun. Days like this are exactly what I hoped to experience here — *work hard, do touristy stuff hard*.
