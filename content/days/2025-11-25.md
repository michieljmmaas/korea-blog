## Continental Breakfast

I woke up unusually early — and finally, no more headache. After a quiet morning of blog work, the hotel Wi-Fi, which had been blazing fast at dawn, slowed to a crawl once everyone else woke up. Breakfast was a simple continental spread. No eggs, sadly, but the sausages were surprisingly satisfying. I squeezed in some last-minute planning too, since I’d switched a few things around on the fly.

## Palace Museum

I began the day at the Palace Museum. Public transit wasn’t ideal from where I was staying, so I grabbed a taxi. The driver didn’t speak English, but showing him the map on my phone worked perfectly.

Inside, the museum was packed with artifacts from the imperial collection — items originally from mainland China, brought over by the KMT during the Chinese Civil War for 'safekeeping'. It was absolutely *packed*: huge tour groups everywhere, and a surprising number of Korean visitors.

Their most famous piece, the Jadeite Cabbage, wasn’t displayed here; it temporarly in display in another palace.

The galleries were filled with trinket, and much of it was genuinely fascinating. The audio guide helped bring a lot of it to life. I’d planned on taking the 2-hour tour, but I lingered for nearly three hours.

Once I’d had my fill, I headed out. I waited about 30 minutes for a bus to my next stop, only to discover it was the city’s hop-on-hop-off service — about five times the price. But at that point, I just needed to get moving.

## Taipei Fine Arts Museum

This museum started off a little underwhelming, but it quickly redeemed itself. A spider-like sculpture caught my attention, and not long after, I stumbled into an incredible art-film installation with layered lighting and sound design. 

It was a movie about a Thai folktale about a demonic monkey that could turn ash into gold. It was displayed in a large dark room, and behind the screen on which the movie was projected, there were lights shone trough the screen. Every 'chapter' the artist was able to think of a way to add a new dynamic to the piece. From flashing lights, surround sound, or ineverting the black and white colors. It was so mesmerizing that I stayed for the entire 47-minute piece.

There was cyber-sigilism art, a park installation with ambient audio, even a cardboard airplane — just an abundance of creative and curious works.

I had to rush through the last few exhibits as closing time approached, but that film installation might be the best thing I’ve seen at any museum here so far.

## Taipei 101

Next up was the quintessential tourist stop: Taipei 101. Once the second-tallest building in the world, it’s still home to the fastest elevator on Earth, launching visitors to the observation deck in seconds.

Since I’d done Tokyo Tower during the day, I tried this one at night. Bad call — daytime views are clearer, and the crowds are lighter.

My ears popped, and my stomach dropped. There’s even a staff member whose entire job seems to be pressing elevator buttons, which feels like a surreal assignment.

The view didn’t wow me, though being hungry definitely didn’t help. The highlight for me ended up being the mass damper: a massive golden sphere that stabilizes the building during high winds.

I also left wanting to try Din Tai Fung — the line was absolutely wild, with people waiting around 90 minutes for a table.


## Raohe Street Market

For dinner I wanted to visit another street market. I know, I know, — but this time I was determined to finally try stinky tofu.

I hopped on a bus and immediately made the classic mistake: got absorbed in a crossword puzzle and didn’t realize I was heading in the wrong direction, until 20 minutes later. I jumped off, spotted the correct-direction bus approaching… and missed it. I walked to the nearest metro station, only to discover there was a bus stop right next to it the whole time, meaning I could have ridden the bus a little longer before getting of.  I’m officially swearing off buses in this country.

Thankfully, the metro got me to Raohe without any trouble. I arrived starving, which made the crowds overwhelming at first. But once I got some food in me, everything smoothed out.

Eventually, I found a vendor selling stinky tofu. I bought a boba as a backup, just in case the flavor was too intense — which turned out to be a smart decision.

The smell is extremely sour and pungent — think fermented funk, almost like a strong blue cheese. You can smell it 5 stalls away. The taste, though, is milder: mostly salty and sour. The was hardly and texture as it was very airy and fried. 

I was hoping the second bite to be better, but it was worse actually. I had to was it down with the Boba. I finished one of the three pieces before throwing in the towel. I stood up, waved to the server, and she understood immediately. I got better food, and headed back to the hotel.

Another long, full day. The Palace Museum was impressive, the modern art museum was a standout, but Taipei 101 left me a bit underwhelmed. At this point, I’ve hit all the major highlights of Taipei. Tomorrow should be a calmer day — hopefully one that ends a bit earlier too.
