# Brain Dump — Full Blog Will Come Later

- I woke up really early — and finally, no more headache!
- Spent the morning doing some blog work.
- The Wi-Fi was blazing fast at first, but slowed down once the rest of the hotel woke up.
- Finally, a *continental breakfast*! No eggs, sadly, but the sausages made me happy.
- I did a bit more planning because I decided last minute to switch some things around.

## Palace Museum

- I started the day at the **Palace Museum**. I took a taxi because the public transit connection was… not great.
- The taxi driver spoke no English, but showing him the location on my phone worked immediately.
- The museum is filled with historical Chinese artifacts from the imperial collection.
- These were “secured for safekeeping” by the KMT during the Chinese Civil War — so almost everything originally came from mainland China.
- It was extremely busy. Huge tour groups everywhere, and surprisingly many Korean tourists.
- Their most famous piece, the **Jadeite Cabbage**, wasn’t on display here — it’s in a different city.

- There was plenty of artwork, and a lot of it was genuinely fascinating. The audio guide helped a lot.
- I took the 2-hour tour but ended up staying for about 3 hours to explore more.

- Once I felt I’d seen enough, I left.
- I waited 30 minutes for the bus to my next stop. When it finally arrived, it turned out to be the city-run hop-on-hop-off bus — 5× the price — but I just needed to get moving. Oh well.
- Had some trouble finding lunch afterward.

## Taipei Fine Arts Museum

- This museum started off a bit rocky — some pieces were kind of “meh” — but it got interesting very quickly.
- There was this cool spider-like sculpture.
- And then I stumbled onto an incredible art-film installation with complex lighting effects. It was so well executed and mesmerizing that I watched the full **47 minutes**.

- There was cyber-sigilism art, a park installation with ambient music, a cardboard airplane — just loads of cool stuff.

<Img feet desc="For free?">

I had to rush at the end because the museum was closing, but that film installation might be the best thing I’ve seen in any museum here so far.

## Taipei 101

Next stop: the must-do attraction. Taipei 101 — formerly the second tallest building in the world — with the world’s fastest elevator, taking you to sweeping views of the city.

I did Tokyo Tower during the daytime, so I tried this one at night.  
**Bad call.** I think daytime views are much better: you see more, and it’s less crowded.

<Img 27 desc="The elevator is insanely fast">

My ears popped, and I felt it in my stomach. There’s a guy whose job is literally to stand there and press the elevator buttons — what a shift that must be.

I wasn’t super impressed, and I was hungry, which didn’t help.

The best part was the **mass damper** — the giant golden orb that stabilizes the building.

I also want to try Din Tai Fung now, because the line for it was absolutely insane — people were waiting **90 minutes** just for a table.

## Raohe Street Market

Yes, yes, I know — another street market. But I wanted to finally try **stinky tofu**.

I took a bus, but I was too focused on my crossword puzzle and didn’t notice I was going in the *wrong direction*. I stayed on it for 20 minutes before realizing.  
I got off, saw the correct-direction bus approaching… and missed it.  
Then I walked to the nearest metro station — only to discover there was a bus stop right next to it, so my walk was pointless.

I am swearing off buses in this country.

The metro, thankfully, got me there without issues.

When I arrived I was *so* hungry that I couldn’t handle how crowded the market was. Once I got some food in me, everything calmed down.

I eventually found a place selling stinky tofu. I bought some boba just in case I hated it — good call.

- It **smells** extremely sour and pungent — think fermented funk, like blue cheese.
- But it **tastes** like… nothing. Just salty, airy fried tofu.

I ate one of my three pieces, washing each bite down with boba.  
I gave the server a look — she understood instantly and said it was okay.

I grabbed some pepper bread and headed home.

Another long, busy day.  
The Palace Museum was fascinating, the modern art museum was fantastic, but Taipei 101 was a bit of a dud for me.

I’ve hit all the major highlights of Taipei now.  
Tomorrow should be more relaxed — hopefully I can end the night a bit earlier.
