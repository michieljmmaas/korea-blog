## Getting There

Waking up this morning was a struggle. I got home a little later — and a little tipsier — than I’d planned last night, and I definitely felt it when my alarm went off. Still, I had to get moving. The weather was perfect for hiking, and with all the recent rain, I didn’t know when I’d get another chance.  

So I packed my gear, filled my water bottle, and headed to the starting point. It was much busier than last week. The first bus that I found taking me to the starting location filled with with other hikers before I could get in, so I had to wait for the next one.  

By 10:00 AM, I arrived and was ready to begin.  

## The First Leg

The first part of the hike was fairly easy — paved paths, clear signs, calm forest streams and mix of green and orange leaves. A great time to catch up on my pollitcal podcasts.

After about two kilometers, though, the path became rougher. The pavement gave way to rocks and dirt, and the climb grew steeper.

The higher I climbed, the mistier it became. I could see the summit getting closer, but the fog rolled in thick. I’d already accepted that there’d be no view waiting at the top — I just wanted to make it there.

## The Summit

After about two hours of hiking, I reached the start of the summit. That’s when things got intense — no more stairs or carved paths, just a metal railing and steep rocks. Those last 300 meters felt tougher than the previous 3,000. The mist was heavy, and it got much colder. I was so glad I hadn’t attempted this last week in the rain.

But eventually, I made it. The summit! I couldn’t see more than five meters ahead, but I joined the long orderly queue of people taking turns snapping photos of eachother. Despite the lack of view, it felt like a huge accomplishment.

After I got my picture taken, I took a break for some food and water. During that short break, I got pretty emotional. This whole trip means a lot to me. I’ve wanted to do this for such a long time, and now making it a reality feels amazing. There have been some hills and valleys so far — not only on this trip but also in the ten years that came before it. Literally summiting Seoul felt like overcoming all of that, knowing I accomplished it on my own with perseverance, dedication, and a dream.

## It’s Going Down!

Next came the descent, facing the city as I went. The clouds had lifted a bit, revealing stunning views. I wanted to recreate a photo I’d taken three years ago on this same mountain with friends, so I started setting up my camera on a rock with a timer.  

Just then, a kind older man walked by and offered to help. In my best Korean, I tried to explain the framing — even showing him the old picture. He first took a few shots in portrait mode, and when I asked for some in landscape, he smiled and obliged. They turned out great!

## Food

By around 15:00 — five hours after I’d started — I finally made it back to civilization. My first thought? “I could really go for some **부대찌개 (Budae jjigae — Army base stew)** right now.”  
I found a restaurant nearby, but when I sat down, the server told me it was only served as a two-person meal. No matter — I was starving.

After eating like a bear before they go into hibernation, I took the metro back, showered, and crashed for a nap. I had planned to visit a sauna afterward to relax, but ironically, I was too tired and just went to bed early instead.  

Today was an exhausiting day, both physically and emotionally, but one I will probably remember for the rest of my life!
