## Heading to the Airport
I woke up on time and did some more preperations before checking out flying back to Seoul. I booked a flight for 12:25, so that I would have some time left when I got back to Seoul. I took the monorail this time, which was a direct connection to the airport. I manged to empty my transit card till there was nothing left, and paint for the remaing tickets using my last bit of cash, while still keeping some enough coins for souveniers. 


I got through the security without issue, and had some time left to kill while waiting for my flight. I some breakfast and worked on my blog before I was called to board the plane.

## The flight back
The flight it self went find. Right before the plane was about to take off, the baby started crying, so I just increased the volume on my headphones. I worked on my blog some more, was servered another meal, and landed about 2 hours boarding.

I got through customs showing my K-ETA form, which is valid for two more years, and was back on the metro to my hotel. Even though I was gone for only few days, it felt nice being back in Seoul. I could read, not fully understand, all the signage again stocked up on some more kimbaps before heading to my hotel room. 

I had planned to do some more administrative tasks, like update my finances, but at it was 17:00 when I finnally put down my bags and took of my shoes.

I was able to get some work done, but not everything I had planned to do. When I looked back up on the clock, it was already 20:00, and I was hungry. Too tired to go to a restraunt I decided to eat some leftovers for dinner and call it a night. 

The trip back took more out of me than I was expecting, so there is still a lot left for me to do. Let's lock in these next couple of days so I can make the best of my last three weeks here!
