## Working Overtime

I spent the entire day working. Woke up around nine and got straight to it — no time to waste. There’s still a lot left to do before I can wrap up my two projects. I managed to clean up my Authentication merge request, incorporate some more feedback, and decided to split off a few parts so someone else can pick them up later. It was a day full of refactoring, but for once, things actually seemed to go my way.  

After writing a few more reviews and catching up on communication, I made myself some lunch. No time to go out or hit the gym today — just a sad little bowl of instant rice and canned tuna. As soon as I sat down to eat, I realized I’d misremembered one of my meeting times and was already late for my first one. I jumped into the call, barely had a chance to chew, and spent the next two and a half hours talking, reviewing, and trying to stay focused.  

Just when I was about to shut my laptop, I discovered a mistake in a migration that had been merged two weeks ago. Thankfully, we didn’t lose any valuable data, but fixing it won’t be easy. There’s always something.  

By the time I finally closed my laptop, it was 20:30. I took a moment to breathe, finished my now-cold “lunch,” and scrolled mindlessly on my phone to unwind. At least I made a solid dent in my remaining work.

Around ten, I went out to grab dinner — the only place still open was Burger King. Two disappointing hamburgers later, I called it a day.  

I leave for Tokyo tomorrow, so I tried to do some last-minute prep and double checks, but my brain was fried. I laid in bed, exhausted but wired, my thoughts racing far past bedtime.  

Let’s try not to have too many days like this one in the future.
