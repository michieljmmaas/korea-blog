> De dag die je wist die zou komen, is eindelijk hier!  

Today I had to pack all of my bags, clean my room, and catch my flight. I had packed my bags two weeks earlier to see if everything would fit and to check what I was missing. This was really useful because I created a system of what to pack where, to make sure everything would fit.

When I was in the basement putting away my things, I met a neighbour. I told her I was leaving for South Korea for 10 weeks, and she replied: *“Of all places, why South Korea?”* This made me think a little bit. Why was I going to South Korea for 10 weeks? I had been so busy the last couple of months, dead set on accomplishing this goal, that I hadn’t taken the time to think about why I was doing all this.  

I left for the airport with two big bags and two large backpacks filled to the brim with snacks and electronics. I met with my parents at the airport to see me off. We had a nice chat about my plans and goals for the trip. They were very sweet, waving goodbye until they couldn’t see me anymore.  

When I got through security, I sat down to write this blog post. And while writing, the answer to the question my neighbour asked came to me: I want to prove to myself that I am capable of doing this. If you had met me 10 years ago and told me that I would be doing all this, there is no way I would have believed you. I have come a long way since then and fought a lot of battles. I think I am doing this to prove to myself that when I set goals—however absurd they might seem—I can accomplish them if I put my mind to it.  

The coming trip will have hills and valleys. But it will also create memories that will stay with me for a lifetime.
