> De dag die je wist die zou komen, is eindelijk hier!

Today I had to pack all of my bags, clean my room, and catch my flight. I packed my bags two weeks earlier to see if everything would fit, and see what I was missing. This was really usefull because I had made a system of what to pack where, to make sure everything would fit.

When I was in the basement putting away my things, I met a neighbour. I told her I was leaving to South Korea for 10 weeks and she reply: "Of all places, why South Korea?". This made me think a little bit. Why was I going to South Korea for 10 weeks? I had been so busy last couple of months, deadset on accomplishing this goal, that I didn't have time to think about why I was doing all this. 

I left for the airport with two big bags, and two big backpacks filled to the brim with snacks and electronics. I met with my parents at the airport, to see me off. We had a nice chat about my plans, and my goals for the trip. They were very sweet and waving goodbye till I they couldn't see me anymore. 

When I got through the security I sat down to write this blogpost. And while writing this post, the answer to the question my neighbour asked, came to me. I want to prove to myself that I was capble of doing it. If you met me 10 years ago, and told me that I would be doing all this, there is no way that I would have believed you. I have come a long way since then, and fought a lot of battles. I think I am doing this to prove to my self that when I set goals, however absurd they might seem, that I can accomplish them if I put my mind to it. 

The comming trip will have hills and valleys. But it will also create memories, that will stay with me for a lifetime.
