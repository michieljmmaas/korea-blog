More to come later

- Who knew there was a ton of caffeine in bubble tea? I sure didn’t! I didn’t sleep until 3.
- But I still woke up with enough energy.
- I got a big breakfast at the breakfast place, that helped.
- I went to M+, and that was awesome! Great museum with cool art!
- To think I didn’t have this in my original planning. 
- But again, quite a lot of kids.
- I also had a ticket for a Cantonese Opera introduction. That was cool! 
- Interesting how the stories they told were quite similar to how the Western canon would tell stories. 
- Both civilizations developed these performing arts separately, but they still have a lot in common.
- I snuck some pictures in even though you weren’t allowed to take them.
- Then back to the hotel for another nap. 
- Then I went to another night market. 
- I was hoping to try some more food carts, but it was just all the same plastic trash ~~imported from China~~.
- I got some chopsticks, had dinner, and went back to the hotel for an early night.
