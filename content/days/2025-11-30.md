## Breakfast
Who knew there was a ton of caffeine in bubble tea? I sure didn’t! I didn’t sleep until 3 after drinking my treat when I got back from MAMA. But the little sleep I did get didn’t affect me much when my alarm went off this morning.

I went to the diner I found yesterday, ready for some breakfast. I ordered the “specialty dish” they had and dug in. I also got another Milk Tea — these things are delicious!

## M+
Today I planned to visit two museums that were close to each other. First I wanted to go to M+ (Modern Art), and then to the Palace Museum, which was right next door. I had bought a ticket to see a Cantonese Opera show at 14:30, so I had to hurry to fit both in.

After that monster breakfast, and taking out some extra cash, I headed to the museum area. I couldn’t find my bus, but I spotted a taxi willing to take me there.

The museum was much larger than I expected — and that was after factoring in that the main floor was closed. I bought a ticket, grabbed an audio guide, and started the tour.

### Dream Rooms: Environments by Women
The museum had multiple exhibitions, and this was the first one. It featured several large installations made by women artists. They were interactive and quite moving. Most focused on the suppression of women in the art world and/or reproduction — the many kids running around didn’t seem to grasp that yet.

The exhibit was a lot of fun and a great start to the museum. It ended with a quote that really spoke to me:

> You must enter the unknown not by accident, but fully aware that you are taking a decisive step  
> Only then, you will know why you are where you are. Don't fret, you won't be alone.

### Sigg Galleries
The Sigg Galleries were specially curated and filled with some great pieces!

The audio guide was great too! I really enjoyed walking around and learning about the art.

### Permanent Exhibition
The permanent exhibition was less interesting, but still had a lot to offer.

By the time I was done, I had no time left for the Palace Museum, so I’ll save that for another day. To think that I didn’t even have this museum on my original itinerary — such a shame! I’m really happy I was able to move things around to make it fit.

I headed over to the Opera House, enjoyed some more nice harbour views, grabbed lunch and a sweet tea, and waited to be seated.

### Xiqu Cantonese Opera Experience 
The Opera House hosts beginner introductions to Cantonese Opera, complete with complimentary dim sum! I made some small talk with the person sitting next to me — an American government employee who originally wanted to go to China but came to Hong Kong instead because she couldn’t get a visa — before the show started.

The show itself was quite interesting. It was in Cantonese, but there were live English subtitles. They covered all aspects of the medium: the music, the action, the martial arts, and the intonation.

It was interesting to learn that this style of opera has different roots from Western opera, yet both evolved naturally alongside each other. The stories they told were also quite similar. There seems to be a human urge for drama, music, and stageplay.

After the show, I felt I had to repay my sleeping debt, so I headed back to the hotel for another nap.

## Mong Kok Night Market
After my nap, I went out to get some dinner. I wanted to see some cool neon signs in the evening, so I asked the internet, and it sent me to Mong Kok. Great — there was supposed to be street food too!

Once I arrived, there were no neon signs (only LED) and no food carts. The market was filled with vendors all selling the same plastic trash ~~imported from China~~. I did manage to score some chopsticks for my friend. I forgot to haggle, but since I’m not paying, I don’t really mind.

Instead of eating street food, I found a restaurant and ordered some clay rice, which was a little underwhelming, and then headed back to my hotel to call it a night.

Today was pretty good! I loved M+, and the Cantonese Opera was a cool experience. I’m really getting a feel for these sweet teas, I’m telling you!
