More to come later

- Who knew there was a shit ton of caffiene in bubble tea? I sure didn't! I didn't sleep till 3
- But I still woke up with enough energy
- I got a big breafast at the breakfast place, that helpt.
- I went to M+, that was awesome! Great museum, with cool art!
- To think I didn't have this in my original planning. 
- But again, quite a lot of kids
- I also had a ticket for Cantonese Opera introdution. That was cool! 
- Interesting how the stories they told were quite similar to how the western canon would tell stories. 
- Both civilisations have developed these performing arts separate from each other, but they still have a lot in common.
- I snuck some pictures in because you weren't allowed to take them.
- Then back to the hotel for another nap. 
- Then I went to another night market. 
- I was hoping try some more foodcarts, but it was just all the same plastic trash ~~imported from china~~
- I got some chop sticks, dinner and went back to the hotel for an early night
