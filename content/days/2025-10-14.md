## Catching up on the blog
This morning I woke up still exhausted. I felt like I was falling behind on my planning, administrative tasks, and the blog. I was supposed to head back to the office, but the urge to get everything organized was gnawing at me.

So I spent the entire morning catching up. I wrote several daily articles, updated my finances, and planned out the remaining time of my trip. Somehow, it feels like I’ve just started — and that I’m already nearing the end. There’s still so much I want to do, so I needed to write it all down.

I’m currently considering skipping my trip to Busan next week, and there are a few reasons for that:

- I wanted to revisit some of the places I went to last time, but I’ve learned that revisiting spots can feel a bit boring.  
- There’s a major Starcraft: Broodwar tournament in Seoul on the Sunday I was supposed to be in Busan.  
- Keeping my weekends free seems smart with how busy things are getting.  
- I only booked the hotel, which I can cancel for free — so no money lost.  

I’ll think about it a bit more, but so far, it seems like a solid plan.

After putting in a few hours at the office, I closed my laptop. I was still tired but had promised myself I’d do something relaxing tonight. Why not visit the sauna? That should do the trick.

# Relaxing at the 찜질방
I headed to a nearby **찜질방 (Jjimjilbang – public bathhouse)** I’d been wanting to visit for years. It was just one metro stop away, so I walked there. Inside was a huge open area filled with mats, small cubbies, and people lounging around. I spent some time sweating it out in the hot rooms, then grabbed a nap on one of the yoga mats — exactly the quiet break I needed after the past few hectic days.

I also had dinner at the canteen — a delicious **순두부찌개 (soft tofu stew)** — and even tried the famous “sauna eggs.” To top it off, I booked a one-hour massage, which turned out to be much rougher than I expected. At one point, I’m pretty sure the masseuse stood on my hand. As it such a unique experience, I wrote a full post about it — <Blog sauna desc="you can read it here">!  

Walking home, I felt refreshed and calm. I was still a bit sore — from both the hike and the massage — but it was a genuinely relaxing evening. Now that I know how easy it is to visit, I’ll definitely be going again in the future!
