## Let's get packing

I spent the majority of the day packing. I came with two pieces of luggage, but for the next two weeks I’ll be living out of one bag, putting the other in storage. I put all my souvenirs, sweaters, and office stuff in one bag, and my clothes, toiletries, and electronics in the other. It was quite a puzzle trying to make everything fit.

I went for my last workout here (gotta get that value from the gym membership) and wanted to run a load of laundry, only to find out that they were servicing the machines today — just my luck. I had to wait two more hours until they were done, so I went to my favorite kimbap place because I had time to kill.

While waiting for my laundry to finish, I made a list of foods I want to try over the next two weeks and freshened up on my Mandarin and Cantonese.

## Ending on a high note

I went to get dinner with Katherine one last time, on my last day. We went to a Korean BBQ place, as you should, and stuffed ourselves with 삼겹살 (porkbelly). After that, we went for a walk in the nearby park, but ended up in a café because it got too cold. We talked and talked until the café closed and then walked back to the station. We said our goodbyes, and I convinced her to take another picture with me.

I am really lucky to have found a friend like Katherine on this trip. We clicked really well — not despite but because of our differences, I feel. The long chats, the nice meals, and the great company gave this trip so much more depth.

## No Ragerts

While riding the metro back to my hotel, I started thinking. Did I do everything I wanted to do here? Did I accomplish everything I hoped for? But every time I thought of something I felt I missed out on, I had an answer for why it didn’t happen.

- I would have loved to visit the ‘Secret Garden’ with the fall foliage, but all the tickets were sold out a month in advance.
- I would have loved to attend a K-pop music show, but I didn’t have the right credentials to apply.
- I would have loved to make some more Korean friends — I did make some, but our schedules didn’t align, so we couldn’t meet up more.

For me to have done all the things I thought of, this trip would have been quite different, and I’m not sure I would have wanted that. That thought gave me peace of mind and lulled me to sleep for one last night in this city.
