Full blog will come later, here are my thoughts:

- Today was a mediocre day I feel, I things didn't really go my way
- I overslept a bit, because I didn't want to use an alarm in the dorm.
- But I was still groggy, because I didn't sleep that good. Lucky this is my last night here
- I got some breakfast on on the subway, which was pretty good
- First I went to a bookstore, because the internet said they would have CDs. The didn't but I had an okay time
- I then went ot my first museum, but all the slots till 16:00 were already sold out, when I got there at 11. I just went onto the second.
- The second museum was the Nizu Museum. Great architecture, the galleries was nice, but no pictures aloud at al.
- The had just opened a new exhibit about 'The Tales of Ise', a long pong that was really popuplar. There were multiple items (paintings, scrolls, fans, shells, cards, lacquer boxes) all making references to the piece. It was pretty cool.
- There was a nice garden, I strolled around in.
- I then wantedto get some lunch, but I was clearly in the wrong area. The area had many luxury stores, so all the place were really over priced. I found two places I wanted to try, but both had long lines. I am willing to do one of these (pay for overprices food, of wait for really good food) but not both. So I got a crappy lunch from the convience store.
- I took a big detour to a souveniershop my dad recommend. They have since remoddeled and significatly remoddeld in size. The used to have 3 big floors, of I recall correctly, they are now around 1/8th the size I feel. I mean, they had only 10 different keyrings, now of which seems that great to me.

## Nitten
- I then went to the The National Art Center. That was super cool!
- These are the 118th NITTEN - The Japan Fine Arts Exhibition. A contents where Japanese artist could submit artworks to be displayed. There were over 3000 pieces! The had many different categories. Big paintings, medium sized paintings, small paitings, sculptures, pottery, calligrahy. It kept going and going!
- I was kind tired because of my lack of sleep and the clumsy day, so I walked through it quite fast, but I could have spent days there I feel!
- This has to be the best value of money for musuem ticket I have ever paid (1/4 a euro cent per art piece) - Not counting free admission

The description recalled a Japanese term for it: 

> Rain that has not know the sky

I loved that!

## Moving Hotels
-  I then went back to the capsule hotel to checkout.
-  I had some mediocre sushi on the way back. I dislike how I can taste the difference, and the I started with possible the best sushi I will eat here. I'll have to go back to Shibuya I feel
-  I checked out of the capsule hotel. The man behind the counter was confused, because checkout time is at 12:00. I said I was 2 nights early, and then he got a little sad.
-  I then went to catch a bus to my new hotel. I couldn't find the busstop. But I saw the exact bus I had catch leaving right before my eyes. I ran after it, dodging tourists with luggage, locals on their phones and seniors with 0 special awareness. 
-  I eventtually caught up with it a the first bus stop, after checking the map for the route.
-  When I got to my hotelroom, I imemdiatly felt at easy.
  -  I took a shower, in my own bathroom.
  -  Unpacked my bags, outside of my locker.
  -  Watched youtube, without headphones
  -  I got into my bed, wearing my own pyamas. 
  - And took a nap!
- After woking up I went and got some dinner.
- The Yakisoba was pretty good. When ringing it up the total was 2222 yen, which made me and the cashier a litle too excited.
- When I got back to the hotel room, I watched the League Of Legends Worlds Finals. The match was pretty good.
- I am going to bed early, to hopefull have a more eventfull day filled me less mistakes tomorrow.
