## Work, work, work
I got up early and started the day in good spirits. The sun was just rising, making the view from my office even better!

There’s this big merge request I’ve been trying to get past review for a while now, but because of its large impact, it’s been difficult to reach a consensus. I agreed with a colleague to put in some extra effort cleaning it up so we could do a final review round. In total, I spent six uninterrupted hours refactoring code, rebasing commits, and writing additional documentation. I got into such a flow that I completely forgot to take a lunch break.  

When I finally looked up and sent out the review request, I realized how late it was. I grabbed a quick lunch, went to the gym, and made it back in time for a few meetings later in the day. I wrapped things up by replying to some feedback comments and sending a few more messages before logging off.  

## Ending the day
By the time I closed my laptop, I was completely drained. I took a bit of time to unwind before heading out to grab groceries at the newly discovered supermarket and some snacks from the convenience store.

I spent the evening watching the livestreamed TWICE concert on YouTube. For the past few days, they’ve been broadcasting their shows for free to celebrate their upcoming 10th anniversary. I missed the previous ones, but I finally managed to catch this one live!  

If I had paced myself better today, I probably would’ve had more energy left in the evening. The last few days had been full of good vibes and momentum, but I definitely overexerted myself and ran out of steam.
