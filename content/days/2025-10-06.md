## Chores and Errands
Since today was **Chuseok**, there wasn’t a whole lot going on. Most big tourist spots were closed as people celebrated with their families. Even the convenience store was closed — to my own inconvenience.  

I spent the morning and afternoon updating my expenses, preparing for the coming weeks, and setting up some dating profiles to meet new people. I also cleaned my room, took out the trash, and did some laundry — really boring stuff, but satisfying to get done.  

I asked the lobby attendant if there would be a Chuseok party for guests. He said there wasn’t one planned, but mentioned there was “something” in the lounge on the top floor. It turned out to be a book about the holiday and a few traditional Korean games. A bit of a letdown, honestly — I had hoped to meet some new people today. Let’s hope Thursday’s event will be more fun.  

## Catching Up on Emails
After finishing my administrative chores, I logged into my work account to catch up on reading and emails I’d missed over the past two weeks. This time I worked from the lounge upstairs instead of my room — and it was actually really nice.  

The rain tapping softly on the glass, mixed with smooth jazz playing in the background, made for a cozy atmosphere. There was a drink station nearby where I could refill my water bottle, but once again, not many people around to talk to.  

After a few hours, I wrapped things up, headed back down to make dinner, and called it a night. Tomorrow, I’ll start putting in some real work hours and see how that goes.  

Even though it was a quiet day, it felt good to get everything back in order.
