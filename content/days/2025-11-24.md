## Sunrise at Alishan

My alarm went off at 4:15, and I left the hotel by 4:30. I’m so glad I did — if I had left even ten minutes later, like the receptionist suggested, I might have missed the train entirely because the platform was packed. The little sunrise train was adorable, even though it was still pitch-dark outside and pretty cramped inside.

After about 25 minutes, we reached the summit. The sky was already glowing behind the mountains. Technically the sun had risen, but the giant peaks were blocking it, so we were all waiting for that first proper burst of light.

I moved to the next viewing platform — a tip I’d picked up from a YouTube video — and managed to get a great spot. And then came the **40-minute** wait. It was chilly, around 10°C, but I had prepared. I was wearing plenty of layers, and had surprise tool that can help us later.

I let a less-vertically-inclined people stand in front of me (as long as I could still see over them). The higher the sun climbed, the more breathtaking the views became. 

And then finally — after about the sun broke free. Many people recorded it on their phones, but I didn’t want a screen between me and the moment. It was absolutely worth the wait.

## Here I go again
At that point, everything caught up with me — the views, the whole buildup, the liqour — and I got emotional again.

Watching the sun appear felt like the symbolic beginning of another day. I’ve been trying so hard to make the most of this trip, and sometimes I scold myself for not enjoying it “enough.” But the sunrise made me realize: **you can’t stop the sun from rising**. Time keeps moving, whether you’re ready or not. All you can do is take it as it comes, try your best and enjoy it all.

I opened my blog and looked at the grid of everything I’ve done these past two months, and it washed over me:

- So many unforgettable memories  
- So many amazing accomplishments  
- So much to be proud of  

I stood there quietly thanking TWICE for bringing me here — emotionally, spiritually, and even physically (otherwise why on earth would I be in Taiwan)? 

By the time I came back to reality, most people had already left — satisfied with their pictures and on their way back to their continental breakfasts. That was perfect, because it gave me the peace to explore the summit a little more on my own.

## The Hike Down

I hiked back down toward the hotel, passing through beautiful forests and viewpoints. This is *exactly* my kind of park:

- Lush greenery  
- Dense trees  
- Huge ancient stumps  
- Mossy paths  
- Scenic railroad tracks  

Everything was well maintained and thoughtfully laid out. I visited all the major spots and genuinely had a great time.

I arrived back at the hotel right on schedule, took a shower, packed my bags and headed out for the bus. I had paid for late checkout so I could enjoy the park a litte more. 

## Going to Taipei
While waiting for the bus, I explored a small exhibit at the station and realized I’d managed to see most the major sights they highlighted. The only things I missed were 'The cherry blossoms' (I was in the wrong season) and 'The Sea of Clouds' (it wasnn't misty enough). Everything else, I saw. And it was great!

The whole area feels like it should be bigger, but I guess that’s just the touristy area of it. There should be off-trail hikes and other bus stops that probably show more of the area. 

The trip to Taipei went smoothly for the most part. The bus took longer then expected, but I napped through most if it, and was lucky to grab a seat on the high speed train.

I’m relieved all the travel worked out despite me booking almost nothing in advance.

## In Taipei
I arrived at Taipei Main Station right around rush hour. There were people rushing everywhere, and everyone was on their phones. When I got to my metro stop I was blessed by the luxery some sidewalks! This modern civil invention hasn't made it way to Kaohsiung yet! 

I checked into my hotel, took a shower, and unpacked a bit. Het hotel is pretty nice, and I’m already excited for the continental breakfast tomorrow. After resting for a while I grabbed dinner at a nearby place. It was okay — a bit pricey, but it was nice to be in a sit down restraunt once again. 

Afterward I got a headache and thought, “Maybe I need more food? Or ice cream?”. I checked McDonald’s, Burger King and MOS Burger, but nothing appealed to me. I figured I’d grab something at 7-Eleven…, but on the walk back I realized I was just extremely tired, so I went straight to bed.

Even though I was in Alishan for less than 24 hours, it left a huge impression on me. The forest was beautiful, the air was so fresh, and I think it genuinely did me good.

It was *definitely* worth all the travel hassle.
