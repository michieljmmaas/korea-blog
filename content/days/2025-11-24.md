Brain Dump — Full Blogpost to Come Later

It’ll take some time to sort through the photos — I took way too many — but here’s the initial brain dump while everything is still fresh.

## Sunrise at Alishan

- My alarm went off at **4:15**, and I left the hotel by **4:30**. I’m so glad I did — if I had left even ten minutes later, like the receptionist suggested, I might have missed the train.
- The train itself was adorable, but it was still dark outside, so there wasn’t much to see from the windows. It was also pretty cramped.
- After around **25 minutes**, we reached the summit. The sky was already glowing behind the mountains.
- The sun had technically risen, but the giant peaks were blocking it, so we were still waiting for that first real burst of light.
- I moved on to the next viewing platform — a tip from a YouTube video — and managed to get a great spot.
- Then came the **40-minute wait** for the actual event.
- It was quite cold, around **10°C**, but I had plenty of layers, so it wasn’t too bad.
- To pass the time (and stay warm), I bought some **plum liquor** and sipped a little while waiting.
- I let a few shorter people stand in front of me — as long as I could still see over them — and everyone was pretty respectful.
- The higher the sun climbed, the more breathtaking the views became. But still, that mountain kept blocking the horizon.
- And then, finally — after about **45 minutes** — the sun broke free. Many people recorded it on their phones, but I didn’t want a screen between me and the moment. It was absolutely worth it.

## The Waterworks

I had another emotional moment — maybe it was the lack of sleep, maybe the liquor, maybe the buildup — but it hit me all at once.

- Watching the sun appear felt like the symbolic beginning of another day.
- I’ve been trying so hard to make the most of this trip, sometimes even scolding myself for not enjoying it “enough.”
- But I realized: **you can’t stop the sun from rising**. Time keeps moving, whether you’re ready or not.
- All you can do is take it as it comes and try your best.
- I opened my blog, looked at the grid of everything I’ve done these past two months, and it washed over me:
    - So many unforgettable memories.
    - So many accomplishments.
    - So much to be proud of.
- I stood there quietly thanking **TWICE** for bringing me here:
    - Emotionally — helping me through hard times.
    - Spiritually — motivating me to keep going.
    - Physically — otherwise why on earth would I be in Taiwan?

By the time I came back to reality, most people had already left — satisfied with their pictures and on their way back to their continental breakfasts. That was perfect, because it gave me the peace to explore the area a bit more on my own.

## The Hike Down

- I hiked back down to the hotel, passing through beautiful forests and viewpoints.
- This is *exactly* my kind of park:
    - Lush greenery  
    - Dense trees  
    - Huge old stumps  
    - Mossy paths  
    - Scenic railroad tracks  
- Everything was well maintained and thoughtfully laid out.
- I visited all the major spots and had a great time.

- I arrived back at the hotel right on schedule.
- Took a shower, packed my bags, and headed out for the bus.
- I had paid for late checkout, and honestly the extra fifteen bucks was **absolutely worth it**.

## Going to Taipei
The bus ride back was fine. I napped a bit, but eventually got very bored.

While waiting for the bus earlier, I explored a small exhibit at the station. I realized I had managed to see *all* the major sights they highlighted. I only missed:
- The cherry blossoms — wrong season.
- The Sea of Clouds — not misty enough.

Everything else, I saw. And it was great!

The whole area felt like it *should* be larger, but I guess that’s just the tourist zone. Off-trail hikes and other stops along the bus route probably go deeper into the mountains.

The train ride back to Taipei went smoothly. It was really busy, but luckily I got a seat. I’m so relieved that all the travel worked out without booking anything in advance.

## In Taipei

- The metro station was packed — I arrived around **18:30**, so I guess it was rush hour.
- Everyone is glued to their phones, even when walking outside. It’s such a funny sight.
- **Sidewalks!** I almost forgot what those looked like after Kaohsiung.
- My hotel is pretty nice, and I’m already excited for the continental breakfast tomorrow.
- I grabbed dinner at a nearby place. It was okay — a bit pricey — but nice to sit down.
- I got a headache afterward and thought, “Maybe I need more food? Or ice cream?”
- I checked McDonald’s, Burger King, and MOS Burger in that order, but nothing on the menus appealed to me, so I left each one without ordering.
- I figured I’d just grab something at 7-Eleven.
- But on the walk back I realized I was just **extremely tired**. So I went straight to bed.

Even though I was in Alishan for less than 24 hours, it left a huge impression on me.  
The forest was beautiful, the air was so fresh, and I think it genuinely did me good.

It was *definitely* worth all the travel hassle.
