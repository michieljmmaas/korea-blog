## Sleeping In
Today I slept in late. I’ve been pretty busy lately, so I needed some extra time to wake up. I scrolled on my phone, watched a few videos, and slowly got some energy back. Eventually I managed to get out of bed, pulled on my sweatpants, and sat behind my PC to work on this blog. I had fallen behind on my daily posts and still needed to write the weekly one. It all came naturally though, and I had fun reliving my trip to Tokyo while scrolling through the photos.

After I had finished most of it, I went out for a run — one last time along the Cheonggyecheon stream. The fall foliage really came through, and the red and yellow leaves made for a beautiful sight.

After my run I grabbed some steamed dumplings from the stall next to my hotel. I’ve walked past that place so many times, always thinking *“I’ll get it one day.”* Well, today was that day. The dumplings were delicious, but not so good that I regret not coming sooner.

## Vibe Coding
I spent the rest of the day writing more blog posts and fixing bugs on the blog. I noticed the images for the food posts weren’t loading at full size anymore, and some of the stats weren’t correct. If you guys find any more bugs, or have suggestions for improvements you can tell me! 

I looked over at my to-do list, and it was still so long. I think my body has sensed that my work commitments are finally over, and it’s now time to relax. I had originally planned to get some souvenirs today, but I figured it would be better to save that for tomorrow and combine it with the food market.

In the evening I just relaxed a bit more and got my favourite dish from the Korean-Chinese restaurant across the street.

I’ve managed to hold off the tiredness for a while, but today I let it wash over me. My next two weeks are filled with adventure and fun, and I want to make the most of it!
