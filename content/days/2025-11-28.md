Just pictures and some comments:

- Spent the morning doing some planning, and now I have something good, I think.
- I had some issues with finding breakfast.
- The National Museum was crazy—it had an exhibit on the 2019 protests, and it was just propaganda.
- Some older locals came in, and they walked out after 30 seconds, not buying any of it.
- There were a lot of school kids there, being indoctrinated.
- The Contemporary Art Museum was nice, but there were a lot of kids running around.
- An exhibit with a personality test.
- I was done faster than I had planned, so I walked the Avenue of Stars.
- I had some goose.
- Then I went to MAMA Day 1.  
  - Got there just on time.  
  - The performances were great, but the awards were really strange.  
  - There wasn’t enough space for all the performers to be placed on the stage like normal, so instead of all the nominees, only the winners were seated there. I could tell who would win.  
  - The awards were also pretty strange, like “Impact of the Year.”  
  - Also, every awards speech made references to the fires.

The girl sat next to me was a huge ELF. I was happy I brought my sound protection.

I was really hungry and thirsty during the performance, which was not great. So I had to scavenge some food when coming back.

Traveling there was also a trip. 

I took way more MAMA pictures, but I don’t have time to go through them all now.

I rushed home trying to evade the crowds.  
Pretty long speeches in the end.
