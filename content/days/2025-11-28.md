Just pictures and some comments:

- Spend the morning doing for planning, and now I have something good I think
- I had some issues with finding breakfast
- The National Musuem was crazy, it had an exhibit on the 2019 protests, and it was just progaganda
- Some older locals came in, and the walked out after 30 seconds not buying any of it
- There were a lot of school kids there, to be indoctrinated.
- Contempary art musuem was nice, but there wer a lot of kids running around
- An exhibit with an personality test
- I was done faster than I had planned, so I walked the Star avenue
- I had some Geese
- Then I went to MAMA day 1. 
  - Got there just on time
  - The performences were great, but the awards were really strange
  - There wasn't enough space for all the performers to be placed on the stage like normally, so instead of all the nominees, only the winners were stat there. I could say who would win.
  - The awards were also pretty strange, like 'impact of the year'
  - Also every awards speech made a references to the fires.

The girl sat next to be was a huge ELF. I was happy I brought my sound protection.

I was really hungry and thirsty all the performance, which wasa not great. So I had to scavage some food when comming back.

Traveling there was also a trip. 

I took way more MAMA picutres, don't have time to go through them all now.

I rushed home trying to evade the crowds. 
Pretty long speeches in the end
