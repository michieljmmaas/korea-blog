## Catching Up
Today was another busy day — not walking around or sightseeing, but catching up on my to-dos. I spent most of the morning updating my blog, prepping for my upcoming trips, and looking at my remaining days in Seoul. It gave me some relief, but I still feel there’s a small mountain of stuff left to do. For lunch, I just ran to a nearby café and grabbed some sandwiches, which I then ate at my desk.

## Work
After that, I shifted into work mode, reading up on communication from the past week and incorporating the feedback I got on my merge requests. I was making some progress, but I can still feel the deadlines looming. In the afternoon my meetings started — and they lasted straight until dinner. I ran a load of laundry and went out for a quick bite.

When I got back to the hotel, I had one more meeting at 20:00 to hash out some final things. After we finally agreed on a solution, it was 21:30 and I was done for the day. I put on my pajamas, brushed my teeth, and when I was ready to hop into bed, I saw there was still a small mountain of laundry I had to put away. I kind of laughed at the symbolism and got to work.

I’m working through the remaining tasks here. I’m steadily making progress, and I feel that I’ll get there — but it’s going to take a whole lot of energy to reach the finish line.
