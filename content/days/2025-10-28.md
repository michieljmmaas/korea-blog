## Waking Up

I got home pretty late the previous day, so I was still tired when my alarm went off. I pressed snooze a couple of times, but after the third one, I finally managed to get up.  
I had a late meeting today, so I allowed myself to take the morning off.

I spent the first few hours of the day updating the blog and doing some planning. I wrote a post about the **Trot Festival** on Saturday [(link here!)](../blogs/trot-festival) and the **StarCraft: Brood War** match on Sunday [(link here!)](../blogs/starcraft-broodwar).  
I also spent some time updating the image modal — the images in the carousel at the top should now load much faster (though at the cost of a little image quality).

After finishing up, I went to the gym. In the elevator down, I accidentally pressed the wrong button while riding with a cleaning lady. She tried to cancel it, but it didn’t work. I reflexively said *“어떡해”* (“What should I do?”), which got a good laugh out of her.

At the gym, they had finally lowered the volume a bit and put on a K-pop remix playlist — perfect workout vibes.

## Work

After a shower, I got back behind my desk to start my day. I fixed another bug, caught up on some messages, and prepared for my meetings.  
At 18:00, my big meeting began and lasted until 20:00. I had bought some snacks to keep me focused, listening along as I watched the sun set outside.

## Closing It Off

When the meeting finally ended, I closed my laptop and went out to grab some food. I visited the local diner again to try something new from their menu — a one-person portion of **탕수육 (tangsuyuk)**, or sweet and sour pork.  
I thought it would be a full meal, but when they brought it out, it was just the meat and sauce. Looking back at the menu, I realized it was listed under the *side menu*, so that explained it. Not a big deal though — I was already pretty full from the snacks I’d had during the meeting.

I closed the day off with some more *Silksong*. The game keeps getting harder, so I decided to backtrack a bit and pick up some upgrades I’d missed earlier. Now it feels much more balanced again.

The past few days have been pretty busy, and the next few look just as packed — so I’m taking things a little slower to recharge my batteries.
