Brain dump - full blogpost to come later.

- Today I went to the south Island.
- I went to the old police quarter. Which was a bit distopian, with how they talked about the policing
- I walked around some more, and found a nice temple
- I then went to a Chop Shop to get a stamp made. It all went a bit too fast, and I might have changed some things if the seller wasn't so pushy. 
- I had and hour to kill to I walked to the bay, to and went into the marine musuem. That was okay. I hoped to get a good shot of the harbeur, with one of those boats, but no luck. Also, the other direction is way better
- I collected the stamp. I will post a picture later.
- I walked back to the HK stock exchange, I couldn't see the trading floor, but was interisting none the less
- I then did the mid-level escaltors (insert stats here)
- nextny up: victoria peak. I took the fernacular, which they wrongly call a tram. IT was really busy
- On top of the hill there is a big mall, correction two malls!
- I had some nice views.
- I doubted to pay the extra money, 7 bucks, to get a better view. Totally worth it.
- It was busy in the top too, 
- I had some michelin star dinner there, But it was pretty bad,
- I went back to the hotel

This day was a bit open for me, but I think I filled it pretty well.
