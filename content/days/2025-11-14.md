## The Final Day
I after a acceptable about of sleep, I woke up pretty early to finish all I wanted to do today. So early in fact, that it was still pre-midnight the Netherlands, which made it so that I couldn't write my Stand-up message in the app yet. I had gotten some final feedback, a mere 3 hours earlier, on my MRs and got to work right away. I started implementing the final suggestions and touch-ups and finally saw the end comming into view. When I finally staisfied with the work, I pressed the 'Merge' button, and felt a sense of relief wash over me.

I spent some more time implementing the new code, writing communcations for my colleageus and clean-up up some test environments I had created for my self. When I finally took a breather, I remember that I had to get a haircut for my photoshoot tomorrow. So I rushed out to the barber across the street, and got seated right away. This haircutting session was not a enjoyable as the first one I had here. The man was stern, pretty rough and was mostly focussed on getting me out of there as soon as possible. Fine by be, I was too focussed on other stuff to be chatty anyway.

## Closing the Laptop
When I got back behind my desk I did some final checks, wrote some documentation for myself when I got back, and wrote nice message for my colleagues thanking them for their cooperation the past 6 weeks. Working remote was bit of a challenge some times, finding time for meetings, confusing time zones, and asynchronous communications all played a part, but I am very happy that I was able deliver on my obligations and finshing things of nicely.  

So I pressed send, and closed my laptop, not to open it for the next four weeks, and start on the 'dessert' of this trip.

## Hongdae with Katherine
To celebrate I went out to dinner with Katherine again. She has since moved out of the hotel to another place, so we found something half way where we could have some food. Hongdae came seemed to be equi-distant, and it has a lot of restaurant and nightlife, so we agreed to meet up there. 

간장게장 (Ganjang Gejang - raw soy marinated crab) was high on my list, and finding a single person portion is almost impossible, so we went to get that. We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, but once we got in the food was served up quick. I tried to scoop out the meat from the crab, but I had done it wrong because the server came over to us and told us to watch the video playing on repeat on the ordering tablet with instructions. It took quite a bit of time and concentration to get the meat out of the crabs, but once we were eating it, it was great!

After the food we walked the streets of Hongdae, and chatted some more. We tried some disgusting candy, played some more arcade games and went into a photobooth to take some pictures.

I am very satisfied that I was able to end my work in a suitable way. Knowing that the next couple of weeks are there just for me to have fun, without any distractions, felt great!
