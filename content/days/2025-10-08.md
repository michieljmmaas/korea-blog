## (C)locking In
Today I put in a few more hours behind the keyboard. I’m making steady progress and slowly getting used to this new way of working. I’m really happy that I’ve been able to maintain my usual routine of programming, working out, and relaxing — even while being nearly 10,000 km away from home.

My dating profile has been performing above expectations, and I’ve been chatting with a few people. It’s fun practicing my Korean like this, though it’s definitely a different experience from speaking it in person. Having the time to think about what I want to say (and double-checking my sentences before hitting send) is a nice confidence boost.  

Let’s see if I can turn any of these matches into actual meetups — they don’t even have to be romantic. At this point, I’d just love a dinner that doesn’t come from a convenience store.
