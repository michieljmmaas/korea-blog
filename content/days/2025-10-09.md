## The Office
I’ve found the perfect place to work here. There’s a spot in the lounge on the top floor with an amazing view of the city. From my seat, I can see all kinds of buildings, businesses, and apartments. Cars flow through the streets below, and people go about their day. I feel like a king overlooking the city — a city I’ve yet to conquer, but one I’ll soon get to know.  

This morning I made some real progress on the tickets I was working on. The preparation I did beforehand turned out to be really useful. But after lunch, I ran into a nasty bug that I couldn’t easily fix. With my colleagues still asleep, I had to figure it out on my own. I had planned to work out again, but this little critter kept me glued to my desk instead. I ended up putting in more hours than planned today, though I can make up for them later.  

At the end of my shift, tickets for the TWICE tour in Europe went on sale. I managed to snag great seats for their show in May at the Ziggo Dome — before everything sold out in just 15 minutes!

## Going Out for Drinks
I had signed up for a Drinks Night with Digital Nomads — I’m really eager to meet some new friends here. I had prepared everything for this trip before leaving, but the social side has been more of a challenge. I was hoping that in a setting like this, there would be others in a similar situation.  

I put on some nice clothes, styled my hair (I still really need a haircut), and headed out. I took the metro to the Sinchon area, which was buzzing with bars, restaurants, and 노래방 (karaoke rooms). When I arrived, a large group was already gathered, drinking and chatting. I took a seat and started talking with the people around me.

I met some really nice people and had fun conversations. There was another software developer (of course), and we talked about programming. I also met someone who does a lot of language exchanges and gave me some great tips on places to visit — a good way to practice my Korean more! We bonded over how hard it is to actually *use* Korean in real life, and how intimidating it can be.  

After about an hour, I found out that the person sitting next to me was staying at the same hotel! She mentioned that the people there seem a bit distant — so it’s not just me noticing that. We exchanged contact info and had a fun chat on the metro ride back. We’re planning to go out for dinner soon!  

I was a little nervous before going to the event, but it ended up being really fun. Of course, people who join events like this are usually pretty social — which makes it easier to connect. I met some great people tonight, and I’m really hoping to stay in touch with them.
