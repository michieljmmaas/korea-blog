## Tired
Even after sleeping for 10 hours straight, I still woke up tired and sore. I might have overextended myself a bit over the past few days, and I’m definitely feeling it now.  

I spent the day back in the office, hammering away at my keyboard. I only went outside to grab some snacks (it was raining again).  

In the evening, I was still exhausted, so I just picked up some food from the hotel store (they have this fridge that unlocks after you pay, and then you can take out what you bought) and spent the night watching StarCraft: Brood War matches. It was the semifinals of the big tournament that’s been running for the past two months. I tried to get tickets, but they sold out too quickly. Hopefully, I can score some for the final, which should be happening on <Day 31 link="asl-season-20--finals">.

I promised myself that I would do something fun tomorrow.
