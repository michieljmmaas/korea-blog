## Racing to the finish line
With only two days of work left, and still a lot to do, I started my day in good spirits. I knew what I had to finish, and it finally felt within reach.

I had gotten some pretty tough feedback on my MR before I left for Japan, but over the past few days I’d had time to think about my implementation. With the extra feedback from a second colleague, things started to click. The refactoring came naturally, and I found better solutions for problems that had stumped me the first time around.

I went out for lunch again to try 삼계탕 (Samgye-tang — ginseng chicken soup). I found a restaurant really close by that had it on the menu. The hostess didn’t speak any English, but my Korean was good enough. When I paid at the register, she even told me my Korean was good (I had said maybe five words in total), but it still put a smile on my face.

After lunch I added some more flair to the authentication code, and finally found time to work out again. With all the stress from work and the Japan trip, I had skipped my prayers in the Temple of Iron for far too long. It felt good to be back.

## Immersion Therapy
For someone who has been in Korea for almost two months, I still can’t stand the taste of kimchi. It’s sour, tangy, and way too overwhelming for me. I like some lighter or fresher versions, but the fully fermented stuff just isn’t my thing. Still, I was optimistic and thought there might be a dish out there that could convert me. That dish, unfortunately, was the one I’d been dreading since I arrived: 김치찌개 (Kimchi-jjigae — kimchi stew). Usually served with some meat and rice, but built around an unavoidable pot of kimchi, the Korean staple.

I walked over to the nearest place that served it, a hole-in-the-wall called “Kimchi Mama” (which sounded promising). Apparently Mama wasn’t in, because the only person there was a tipsy older man who reluctantly welcomed me and gave me a seat.

A hot stone bowl of fermented cabbage left the kitchen soon enough, and after the first few bites I knew: kimchi just isn’t for me. I felt bad giving up so fast and leaving the man alone again, so I told myself I’d at least eat what “Mama” served me. I thought that after the tenth bite I’d come around, but no. I finished the bowl to the best of my ability, left the man to his TV program, and immediately ducked into a 7-Eleven to get some kimbap to wash away the taste.

## The Last Check-in
After dinner I had a meeting with one of my colleagues to discuss the work I had left. We came to a reasonable agreement on what was feasible for me to wrap up and found a way for me to leave things nicely tied with a bow. I had hoped I could merge all my code back in and be done with it, but merging and then disappearing for four weeks wasn’t his preferred option. So we landed on a good middle ground that works for everyone and even saves me some effort.

Today I felt the mountain of work in front of me shifting and shrinking. I made steady progress, found a good “landing zone,” and now I have the end in sight. It was a huge relief, knowing that everything will work out.
