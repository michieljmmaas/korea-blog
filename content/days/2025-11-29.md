Just pictures and some comments:

- I wasn't feeling it at all when I woke up. Really bad. 
- I went to the hertiage msuem and got some sloppy breakfast, not food either
- I found out I made a planning error.
- The heritage museum was great, some nice exhibition, what I was to exhausted to get any of it. 
- I tried getting some good lunch, pizza, but that didn't work.
- Just went back to the hotel to nap. That worked great!
- I did some laundry
- Explored the neighbourhood, and foud a good breakfast place and a Mixue!
- I also met some nice ladies who offered me a massage!
- I did some basic chinese lessons in an app in my phone, and it immediatly helped me understand the lanuage better.
- I also already recognized some of the characters when walking the street.
- MAMA day 2 was easier to get to. I planned better and now had some more food and drink with me. 
- The performances weren't as good I felt. 
- I got almost the same seats, a little better maybe. 
- Finally a good honoring of the victims of the fire by Chow Yun Fat!

- I left the stadium after the artist of the year was announced. To beat the crowds. I didn't believe he should have won. 
To treat my self for better planning, I got more Mixue Bubble tea, and some Doner.
