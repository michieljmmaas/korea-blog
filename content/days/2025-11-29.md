Just pictures and some comments:

- I wasn’t feeling it at all when I woke up. Really bad. 
- I went to the heritage museum and got some sloppy breakfast—not good food either.
- I found out I made a planning error.
- The heritage museum was great, with some nice exhibitions, but I was too exhausted to take any of it in. 
- I tried getting some good lunch—pizza—but that didn’t work out.
- Just went back to the hotel to nap. That worked great!
- I did some laundry.
- Explored the neighborhood and found a good breakfast place and a Mixue!
- I also met some nice ladies who offered me a massage!
- I did some basic Chinese lessons in an app on my phone, and it immediately helped me understand the language better.
- I also already recognized some of the characters when walking the streets.
- MAMA Day 2 was easier to get to. I planned better and had more food and drink with me. 
- The performances weren’t as good, I felt. 
- I got almost the same seats, maybe a little better. 
- Finally, a good honoring of the victims of the fire by Chow Yun Fat!

Best performances:

- I left the stadium after the Artist of the Year was announced, to beat the crowds. I didn’t believe he should have won. 
- To treat myself for better planning, I got more Mixue bubble tea and some döner.
