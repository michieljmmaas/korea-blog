## Plugging Away at It
Today was just a normal day at the office. I caught up on missed messages, updated my merge requests after some feedback, and fixed a few bugs.  

For lunch, I went back to the supermarket. I stocked up on some essentials (bananas, mayonnaise, and protein bars) and grabbed a few more kimbaps at the convience store.  

Back at work, I made some progress on my new feature, but sticking to my new schedule, I took a mandatory break to work out. Unfortunately, I mistimed it, which made me a few minutes late for a meeting with some colleagues, they were nice enough about it though!

On Sunday, there’s a big StarCraft tournament here in Seoul — one of the reasons I cancelled my trip to Busan this weekend. I would’ve taken the train this evening, but decided to stay in Seoul instead. The tickets of the match went on sale at 17:00, and I was ready to buy, but as soon as I got in and the purchase process started, all tickets were already gone — within seconds!  

Such a bummer, missing out on tickets like this again. Now I feel bad for skipping my trip to Busan. I still have some fun stuff planned instead, but the main reason for staying here just vanished. Apparently, they sometimes let people in without a ticket, so I’ll try that, but still — what a disappointment. I do have tickets for a StarCraft x K-pop event next Thursday to make up for it, but attending this tournament would’ve been even cooler.  

## Winding Down
I felt a bit down in the evening, so I played some more *Silksong* to relax — finally making some progress again after beating Trobbio. Around 20:00, I decided not to let the whole ticket situation ruin my evening, so I went out for food. There’s a small restaurant right across the street — I can see it from my window — that I’ve been wanting to try for a while now.  

It was empty when I got there, but I was so hungry I didn’t let that deter me. I ordered a portion of 자장면 (*Jajangmyeon* — noodles with black bean sauce). It was really good, and cheap too! I kind of feel like a sucker for cooking dinner at home when there’s such a convenient restaurant right next door.

I finished the night with a stroll along Cheonggyecheon Stream, just like yesterday, to cool off a bit (and get my steps in for the day). Then I went to bed early and got my well-deserved rest.  

The day was going great until I missed out on the StarCraft tickets — but I managed to save it by finding a good restaurant and taking a walk to clear my head.
