## Tokyo Tower

After waking up from one of my best sleeps yet, I was recharged and ready for another day of adventuring. My first stop of the day: **Tokyo Tower**. It was only a short walk away, and for once, I got inside without waiting in line — a first here! I enjoyed this way more than I expected. I took in the city views, watched the ant-sized people below going about their day, and read up on the tower’s history.

It was erected after the Second World War, built partly using scrap metal from tanks to create a radio tower and instill a new sense of national pride after Japan’s defeat. Standing 333 meters tall, it was purposefully made just a little higher than its cousin in Paris.

It was a bit too cloudy to see Mt. Fuji, which was unfortunate, but that didn’t stop me from taking plenty of photos.

## Reiyūkai Shakaden

From my elevated view, I spotted an intriguing building: the **Reiyūkai Shakaden**, the main temple of a modern Japanese Buddhist movement. It’s the black, James Bond–villain-looking building on the left side of the picture above. It was on my route to the next stop, so I decided to take a closer look.

Up close, it was just as striking — massive steps, dark angular layers, and an ominous yet oddly calming presence. I walked in to take a better look. The place was empty except for a janitor. I bowed to him, and he bowed back, but as soon as I climbed the second flight of stairs, he rushed after me to tell me that the roped-off sections were off-limits and that I couldn’t take pictures of certain areas. It gave me some culty vibes, so I left soon after — but not before snapping a photo from outside.

## Time to Kill

I had some time to kill before my next stop at 14:00. My original plan was to visit **teamLab Borderless**, an interactive multimedia art exhibition. The photos online looked interesting, and since it was nearby, I figured, why not? But when I got to the entrance, all tickets were sold out for the day. I was disappointed at first, but considering the tickets were more than double what I prepared to pay of it, the sting didn’t last long.

So instead, I grabbed some lunch and thought about what to do next. I had planned to visit the **Tokyo Biennale** later in the day, but I could move that up a bit. Every two years, art pieces are placed all around Tokyo for people to discover. This year’s theme was *“Take a Stroll”*, encouraging participants to explore the city and see what they find. My plan had been to do this later in the day, but by then it might’ve been dark, so I gave myself an hour to see what it was like first.

I traveled to Tokyo Station, where the first art piece was supposed to be. The description was vague — just *“in front of the Daimaru Tokyo.”* I spent 45 minutes running around trying to find it. I expected something big — a mural, maybe a sculpture — but the Daimaru is a massive department store with multiple buildings and countless entrances. I was losing my mind. How could I not find this? The station was packed with travelers and rolling luggage, making it even harder to move around.  

Eventually, I gave in and went *into* the Daimaru to see if it was hidden inside. Big mistake — instant sensory overload. The first floor was just wall-to-wall confectionery stalls, people shouting and even more people with too much luggage.

Then, after all that, I found it. The “art piece” was a giant painting on the… floor. I hadn’t noticed it before because it looked like a rug — and people were walking all over it. It was such an anticlimax that I gave up on the Biennale entirely and decided to head to my next stop early.

## National Diet Building Tour

Next up was a tour of the **National Diet Building**, the heart of Japan’s government. I had only discovered they offered tours while in Japan, and I signed up through a slightly sketchy email-link — but this morning I got confirmation that I’d been accepted for the 30-person English tour. I was *way* too excited.

I find politics fascinating, and this was a rare opportunity. But I also wanted to visit because of **Tomiichi Murayama**. I was born on January 5th, 1996, in Tomisato — the same day Japan’s last Socialist Prime Minister stepped down. I learend about this because for my 25th birthday, I found a digital copy of the *Mainichi Shimbun* front page that had it as a headline. So I looked into him and his legacy. He is most know for publishing the [Murayama Statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murayama_Statement), officially apologizing for Japan’s wartime aggression — the first and only Prime Minister to do so. The man’s been on my “Nice” list ever since.

The tour began with some paperwork and passport checks before we were ushered into a small elevator and taken to the House of Representatives. We sat in the public benches while our tour guide — a security guard with a thick accent — read from a prepared booklet like it was a school presentation.

We then walked past a TV broadcasting a live session from the House of Councillors, where the current Prime Minister was answering questions — less than 500 meters away. We weren’t allowed in, but it was still cool to be that close to real politics.  

We saw the central hall, the Emperor’s waiting room, and quickly passed a gallery with portraits of former prime ministers. I caught a glimpse of one man with grey hair and heavy eyebrows — had to be Murayama! I snapped a quick photo before being ushered along again.

The tour ended in the garden, where each prefecture has planted a representative tree or flower. We were allowed to take exterior photos before being politely steered toward the gift shop. Naturally, I had to check it out — my first *parliament gift shop*!  

I scanned past the boxes of cookies shaped like Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi — the country’s first female PM, appointed less than three weeks ago (they move fast!) — and found a binder with portraits of past Prime Ministers. I pointed at the man with the grey hair and thick eyebrows and asked, “Murayama?” The cashier looked surprised. “Yes, you know?” she said. I just smiled and replied, “Yes!” — and bought it.

## Shibuya Part 2

At this point, I didn’t have much energy left or many plans remaining, so I headed back to Shibuya to end the trip on a high note.

### Tower Records

I still wanted to pick up some CDs while in Japan, so I stopped at **Tower Records Shibuya** — seven floors of music heaven. I browsed through the aisles, listened to some questionable J-Metal, and eventually made it to the K-pop section.  

Right as I entered, I was greeted by an entire aisle dedicated to **TWICE**. I looked through everything and decided to buy the album featuring my favorite Japanese release. I also tried my luck at the TWICE Gachapon machine and got a *Chaeyoung* keychain!

I passed through their “Hall of Fame,” filled with artist autographs, then headed back out — across that damned crosswalk again — toward my final meal.

### Tenkazushi

To close out the trip, I returned to the same sushi spot as before. I arrived around 16:00, got a seat immediately, and decided to see if I could beat my previous record. The sushi was just as good as I remembered, but since it was quieter, I had to ask the chef directly for my new favorite: **Anago** (saltwater eel). After ordering two plates, he decided to make more for the belt, but no one else took any — which meant more for me!

After about half an hour and 18 plates, exhaustion hit me hard. Japan had been incredible, but the long days, short nights, and constant sensory overload were catching up. I stared blankly at the revolving belt, totally zoned out — until another plate of Anago slid into view. The chef, probably noticing how deflated I looked, had made me another one *just for me* and handed it over.   

I thanked him, savored every bite, and decided it was time to head back. I let my old record stand, paid the bill, and returned to my hotel. Like my smartwatch, I was completely out of battery. And really — what’s the point in walking more if you can't even track it?

## The Final Night

I spent the evening winding down, organizing photos, and pre-packing my bags. Later, I grabbed some more convenience store food, used the complimentary hotel amenities, and went to bed.

<Img 20 desc="I still had to try yakitori, but the convenience store version was a disappointment.">

It was another messy day in the end. If I’d gotten tickets to *teamLab Borderless* earlier, the day might’ve felt smoother — but I still think I made the best of it. And honestly, if I had any energy left, I would’ve spent it.
